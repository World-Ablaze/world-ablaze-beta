To fit the gun, the BT-7art's turret has to be significantly enlarged from the original model. The added weight leads to significantly reduced speed, which is the defining trait of the BT line. As is the case with most assault guns, soft attack values are very good, but it comes at a cost to breakthrough."

However, its gun has extremely poor armor penetration, using the same 37mm gun as the Hotchkiss H35. Additionally, the 2 man crew and lack of radios meant that the tank suffers in the same way most other French tanks did when it came to coordination.

However, this means that the amount of armor on the turret is reduced to make room for the new crew member. Compared to the Hotchkiss 39, this design sacrifices armor for increased speed and breakthrough. However, the lack of radios means that coordination on offensive and defensive operations is still difficult."

It utilizes a 2-man turret and extensive armor sloping. The tank has no vision slits, so the only way to see out of the tank is a panoramic periscope at the top of the turret.Though the tank is intended to be given a radio, there is no designated radio operator.

Though the transition from the AMX 13 75 to the AMX 13 90 has mostly marginal stat increases, the value for piercing is almost doubled due to the introduction of HEAT shells."

One key difference from its predecessors is its use of 4 crew members, finally having both a dedicated gunner and radio operator. In many ways, this tank performs more similarly to a medium tank than a light tank. It outshines other light tanks in every single stat, but is much more expensive to produce.

Due to the small size it inherited from the Renault FT, it is not able to fit a dedicated gunner, loader, or radio operator into the vehicle. This lack of manpower and small nature of the turret, makes it extremely difficult to use the gun effectively.

Unfortunately, this technique makes the construction process extremely complex, resulting in a high production cost for the tank. Additionally, the tank is very unreliable, which only further aggravates its high production cost.

Unlike other French tanks, it is designed with AT combat in mind and comes with significant improvements for piercing and mobility. however, anti-infantry capability is left untouched.

This new turret design allows for dedicated crew members for different jobs in the tank. However, it must be significantly larger to maintain a similar level of armour protection, making the vehicle significantly more costly to produce. It also features an enlarged cupola, making it easier for the commander to spot enemy targets while on offensives, but at the same time making the tank easier to spot."

Due to its armor, it has a reputation for being invincible on the battlefield. However, its lack of firepower and manoeuvrability means that the tank is ill-suited for fighting anything other than infantry.

    tank_pol_medium_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Polish-developed variant of the widely exported British Vickers 6-ton, the vehicle is extremely lacking in all-around offensive power. Its machine gun armament is useful for fighting against weakly armed infantry but will struggle against any form of enemy armour.\n\n As is the case with most early-war tank designs, a limited 3-person crew restricts the ability of the vehicle to operate as a coordinated fighting force in the midst of combat."

    tank_pol_medium_chassis_1_2_desc:0 "This vehicle makes massive improvements on its predecessor by including a 37mm anti-tank gun, a more reliable engine, a periscope and a radio.

The addition of a powerful engine and hydraulic steering servomechanism allow the tank to reach such speed.\n\n An enlarged hull also means that a larger crew of 4 can fit inside, greatly alleviating the task burden of the commander. The tank is very unreliable due to the use of foreign parts."

The significant increase in protection allows it to be on par with the armour of many major nation's medium tanks; however, the vehicle is still likely to be pierced by most anti-tank weapons.\n\n Experience from the 10TP greatly improves reliability in this vehicle."

    tank_swe_scout_car_chassis_1_desc:0 "The L-180 is a very good scout car for its time. While it excels in its primary scouting role, it is also useful in infantry support role, using its mobility to harrass soft-skin vehicles and infantry."

    tank_swe_scout_car_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Pansarbandvagn 301 makes little improvements over its predecessor. Its improved armament allows it to pierce other scout cars it may encounter on reconnaissance roles, but most of the vehicle stats have undergone no changes and are severely out of date."

    tank_swe_light_chassis_1:0 "§W§!Stridsvagn m/29§W§!"
    tank_swe_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "A variant of the German designed Leichter Kampfwagen II, the Stridsvagn m/29 is armed with two machine guns and powered by a Scania-Vabis engine. It is extremely outdated and should avoid combat use at all costs. It is best to serve as a training vehicle."

    tank_swe_light_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Stridsvagn L-60 m/38§W§!"
    tank_swe_light_chassis_2_desc:0 "The Stridsvagn L-60 m/38 mounts a 20mm Madsen autocannon best suited to fight against infantry and lightly armoured vehicles. While the vehicle is well-rounded it does not excel in any particular area. It has a three man crew, restricting the amount of tasks the crew can handle at once."

    tank_swe_light_chassis_2_2:0 "§W§!Stridsvagn L-60 m/39§W§!"
    tank_swe_light_chassis_2_2_desc:0 "Accomodating a 37mm gun, the 1939 variant of the L-60 is able to easily pierce most vehicles but is relatively lacking in terms of raw firepower. Its three man crew prevents the vehicle from being used to its highest potential."

    tank_swe_light_chassis_assault_2_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nThe Stormartillerivagn m/43 provides a healthy amount of firepower in the form of a 75mm howitzer enclosed in a casemate. Because the weapon is restricted to a light tank chassis, the firepower is not as high as other contemporary assault guns."

    tank_swe_light_chassis_assault_2_2_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nThis variant of the Stormartillerivagn m/43 is equipped with a 105mm howitzer. The light chassis prevents the gun from being utilized to its full potential due to the large amount of weight and recoil."

    tank_swe_light_chassis_aa_2_desc:0 "The L-62 anti-air variant is capable of dealing with most aircraft. Its 20mm autocannons are also effective against light and medium armour, allowing this vehicle to serve in a wide range of roles for a cheap price."

When compared to the Stridsvagn m/42 it is built off of, it has much weaker piercing and worse combat stats overall. Its one saving grace is that its simple structure makes it easier to produce."

    tank_swe_medium_chassis_td_2_2_desc:0 "The IKV 72 provides the same amount of anti-tank capability as the Stridsvagn m/74 but is significantly cheaper to produce. This tank destroyer is best on the defensive but does not perform as well in offensive breakthroughs."

    tank_swe_medium_chassis_assault_2_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nThe IKV 103 is an assault gun capable of moving rapidly across the battlefield to provide support. Unlike most assault guns, its piercing is able to deal with medium levels of armor quite effectively. It can still be produced at a very cheap cost, providing a wide range of benefits for very little."

    tank_swe_medium_chassis_aa_2:0 "§W§!Luftvärnskanonvagn fm/43§W§!"
    tank_swe_medium_chassis_aa_2_desc:0 "Alterations to the turret design allow for improved aircraft targetting. Usage of the same gun allows the vehicle to continue performing against light armour and infantry."

    tank_swe_modern_chassis_3:0 "§W§!Stridsvagn 103§W§!"
    tank_swe_modern_chassis_3_desc:0 "Capable of piercing all but a few tanks, the Stridsvagn 103 is a heavily armoured but expensive tank destroyer. As is the case with most tank destroyers, it does provide the strongest offensive stats but is extremely powerful with holding positions against armoured opponents."




    tank_swe_heavy_chassis_1:0 "§W§!EMIL I§W§!"
    tank_swe_heavy_chassis_1_desc:0 "Expensive but powerful, the Emil is designed to counter numerically superior armoured forces. Heavily based on French and German designs, this vehicle has an oscillating turret and very heavy armour. Equipped with a powerful gun, it is able to make short work of enemy vehicles."

    tank_swe_heavy_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Kranvagn§W§!"
    tank_swe_heavy_chassis_2_desc:0 "An improvement on the Emil, the Kranvagn heavily improves on all offensive stats, making this vehicle extremely powerful on the battlefield. This tank is very expensive, but is the best option to conserve Sweden's small manpower reserves."
