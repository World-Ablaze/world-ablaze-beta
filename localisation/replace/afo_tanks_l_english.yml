To fit the gun, the BT-7art's turret has to be significantly enlarged from the original model. The added weight leads to significantly reduced speed, which is the defining trait of the BT line. As is the case with most assault guns, soft attack values are very good, but it comes at a cost to breakthrough."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_1:0 "§W§!Renault FT§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Renault FT lay's the foundation for all future tank designs, having a very reliable and stable build with the standard tank layout. It is however extremely outdated"

    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2:0 "§W§!Renault R35§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2_desc:0 "Support Tank\nThe Renault R35 has decent armor and anti-infantry fighting capabilities to fulfill its infantry support role. However, its gun has extremely poor armor penetration, using the same 37mm gun as the Hotchkiss H35. Additionally, the 2 man crew and lack of radios meant that the tank suffers in the same way most other French tanks did when it came to coordination. It had a single cupola that was rotatable, but has to be hand-cranked by an already overburdened commander."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2_2:0 "§W§!Renault R40§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2_2_desc:0 "Support Tank\nSimilarly to the Hotchkiss H35, the Renault R35 was deemed to have an insufficient gun. The Renaults R40's L/35 37mm gun is extended for increased armor penetration. Radios are also included the tank, but as is the case for other early war French tanks, the limited crew means that the addition of the radio only serve to increase the workload of the already strained commander, resulting in reduced defensive and breakthrough ability."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!Hotchkiss H35§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Hotchkiss has extremely poor steering when driving across uneven terrain. Its relatively high armor and an L/35 37mm SA38 gun allows it to perform well in an anti-infantry role. The Hotchkiss retains the FT's two man crew layout. Despite this fact, the tank is so small that the crewspace is still extremely cramped, making it even more difficult to focus on matters of battle."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!Hotchkiss H39§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "To achieve higher speeds, the H39 improves upon the H35's engine significantly. The track and suspension are also improved, easing many of the original tank's issues with maneuverability. The tank uses an elongated L/35 37 gun to achieve greater armour penetration. Some tanks are even given radios, but due to their 2 man crew, it is still difficult to use effectively while multitasking."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_4:0 "§W§!AMC 35§W§!"
    fra_light_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The AMC 35 is one of the few French-designed tanks of its time to incorporate a two-man turret. However, this means that the amount of armor on the turret is reduced to make room for the new crew member. Compared to the Hotchkiss 39, this design sacrifices armor for increased speed and breakthrough. However, the lack of radios means that coordination on offensive and defensive operations is still difficult."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_5:0 "§W§!AMX 40§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_5_desc:0 "Support Tank\nRather than providing large amounts of firepower, the AMX 40 serves in heavily armoured units that can protect infantry during an offensive. It utilizes a 2-man turret and extensive armor sloping. The tank has no vision slits, so the only way to see out of the tank is a panoramic periscope at the top of the turret.Though the tank is intended to be given a radio, there is no designated radio operator.  Though there are small offensive improvements on the Renault R40, the biggest change was in the large increase in armor plating. "

    tank_fra_light_chassis_6:0 "§W§!AMX 12§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_6_desc:0 "This revolutionary design has an oscillating turret. Its revolver type magazine utilizes autoloaders, allowing the tank to dispense large amounts of firepower. Unfortunately, after firing the tank has to be pulled back to safety because the tank has to be reloaded from outside the vehicle. Its reliable chassis served as the basis for all French light tanks until 1985. It included a radio but did not have a designated radio operator."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_7:0 "§W§!AMX 13 75§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_7_desc:0 "Based off of the prototype AMX 12t design, the AMX 13 75 improves the tank across all areas, incorporating a 75mm SA 50 gun for increased firepower. Compared to other light tanks of the time, it has one of the highest armor values but lower piercing."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_7_2:0 "§W§!AMX 13 90§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_7_2_desc:0 "Continuing on the AMX 13 line, the 90 variant swaps out the 75mm gun for a 90mm F3 medium pressure gun capable of firing high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells. Though the transition from the AMX 13 75 to the AMX 13 90 has mostly marginal stat increases, the value for piercing is almost doubled due to the introduction of HEAT shells."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_8:0 "§W§!BC 25t§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_8_desc:0 "The Batignolles-Chatillion Char 25t is an extension of the design introduced in the AMX 13 line, using the same oscillatory turret design and autoloader armament. One key difference from its predecessors is its use of 4 crew members, finally having both a dedicated gunner and radio operator. In many ways, this tank performs more similarly to a medium tank than a light tank. It outshines other light tanks in every single stat, but is much more expensive to produce. When compared to mediums, it has fairly average stats, but is lacking severely in armor protection."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_assault_1_desc:0 "The Renault FT fitted with a short-barrel Blockhaus Schneider 75mm gun. Due to the small size it inherited from the Renault FT, it is not able to fit a dedicated gunner, loader, or radio operator into the vehicle. This lack of manpower and small nature of the turret, makes it extremely difficult to use the gun effectively. This means that, though the BS had a large improvement in soft attack from the original FT, its values for breakthrough and defense are atrocious."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_6:0 "§W§!AMX 105 AM§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_6_desc:0 "The AMX 105 AM fits an accurate and devastating 105mm gun on the chassis of the AMX 12t. However, the recoil has much more force than the small chassis is meant to handle, meaning it is prone to breaking down  or malfunctioning in the field."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7:0 "§W§!AMX 13 AM§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7_desc:0 "Using a 155mm gun on the AMX 13 chassis, this SPG has good soft attack values but suffers from the same issues of its predecessor, as the chassis was not designed to handle the recoil of such a large gun."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7_2:0 "§W§!AMX 13 F3§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7_2_desc:0 "Using a 155mm gun, the AMX 13 F3 does not provide as much soft attack as some larger SPGs, but it is by no means small. It is very cheap to produce and fixes some of its predecessor's reliability issues, making it worth considering."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_aa_7:0 "§W§!AMX 13 DCA§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_aa_7_desc:0 "A French iteration of the universal Bofors 40mm turns the AMX 13 into a capable, rapid and reliable anti-air vehicle, although as to be expected, it has no armour to speak of."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_1:0 "§W§!Renault D1§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_1_desc:0 "Building on lessons learned from the FT, the D1 serves as little more than a stepping stone to greater things. With terrible piercing, snail-like speed and woeful reliability, the D1's only saving grace is marginally better armour than its interwar peers. Even this advantage would quickly be undone by advancements in weaponry."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Renault D2§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_2_desc:0 "To reduce weight, the Renault D2 uses a novel technique that removes the need for internal girders that would have increased the weight of the vehicle. Unfortunately, this technique makes the construction process extremely complex, resulting in a high production cost for the tank. Additionally, the tank is very unreliable, which only further aggravates its high production cost. A key improvement in the D2 is the addition of a 3rd crew member as a dedicated radio/telegraphy operator."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3:0 "§W§!SOMUA 35§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Somua S35 employs well-sloped, casted armor and simplifies production. Unlike other French tanks, it is designed with AT combat in mind and comes with significant improvements for piercing and mobility. however, anti-infantry capability is left untouched. Considered one of the best tanks of its time, a single-man turret and poor strategic use of the vehicle prevented it from operating at peak effectiveness."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!SOMUA 40§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "The S40 enlarges the cupola originally present in the S35. The novel turret is welded and installed on a redesigned super structure, helping to improve costs and armour protection. Compared to the S35, values such as piercing and speed are largely the same. Due to the improved spotting from the new cupola, this tank has greatly improved breakthrough over its predecessor."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_4:0 "§W§!SOMUA S40 bis§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_4_desc:0 "Offering various incremental improvements over the S40, most notably slightly increased armour and better reliability, the S40 Bis retains the S35 gun. Once a world-class anti-tank gun, it now struggles against the armour of opposing armies."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_5:0 "§W§!SARL 42§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_5_desc:0 "The SARL 42 replaces the typical French one-man-turret with one capable of fitting two crew members and a larger gun. This new turret design allows for dedicated crew members for different jobs in the tank. However, it must be significantly larger to maintain a similar level of armour protection, making the vehicle significantly more costly to produce. It also features an enlarged cupola, making it easier for the commander to spot enemy targets while on offensives, but at the same time making the tank easier to spot."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_6:0 "§W§!Char G1§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_6_desc:0 "The Char G1 is intended to incorporate features such as gun stabilisation, semi-automatic loading, and optical rangefinders. These advancements, along with the introduction of an L/32 75mm gun lead to a significant increase in offensive capability against both infantry and tanks. This tank incorporate a two man turret and allows the commander to aim the gun himself to double as a gunner if he so chooses. This is France's first medium tank that can be considered on-par with the tanks of industrialised majors while still being relatively cheap to produce."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Somua S40, the S35 CA replaces the turret with a mounted casemate, allowing it to mount a larger gun capable of piercing enemy tanks. Due to its shape, it earned a nickname as "The Bathtub". The reduced complexity as a result of removing the turret, allows for a cheaper production cost of the tank. While the tank destroyer has reduced breakthrough from its original variant, it excels when destroying tanks due to its elevated piercing and hard attack values."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3_2:0 "§W§!SAu 40 (75)§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3_2_desc:0 "An average tank destroyer, the 75mm variant of the SaU 40 has piercing and armour values that make it capable in armoured combat. A lack of good vision slots means the TD struggles with its breakthrough and defense values."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_4:0 "§W§!SAu 40 bis (75)§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_4_desc:0 "Incorporating the advancements of the S40 bis's chassis into the casemate concept of its predecessor, the SAu 40 bis provides okay anti-tank capability while remaining more heavily armoured than foreign contemporaries."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_assault_3:0 "§W§!SAu 40 (105)§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_assault_3_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nThe SAu 40 contains a 105mm howitzer, providing it with a very high amount of soft attack at the cost of piercing. The pronounced turret on top of its superstructure makes the tank easy to spot, and as a result, its breakthrough is significantly reduced."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_assault_4_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nMounting the same howitzer as its previous iteration, this version of the SAu 40 bis excels at destroying softer targets. The overly large machine gun turret has been removed, turning the SAu 40 bis into a very low and hard to spot target."



    tank_fra_modern_chassis_1:0 "§W§!AMX M4§W§!"
    tank_fra_modern_chassis_1_desc:0 "Bridging the medium and heavy tank lines together, the AMX M4 45 brings together their maneuverability and combat traits. This sets a trend for future French heavy tanks, as many of them favor their mobility at the cost of relatively low armor protection as a heavy tank. It has excellent combat stats, after incorporating design elements from the German Tiger II tank."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Lorraine 40 90§W§!"
    tank_fra_modern_chassis_2_desc:0 "The Lorraine 40t retains the oscillating turret from the AMX and Bat-Chat tank lines. Due to the advent of hollow charge anti-tank weapons, it is difficult to make a tank impenetrable without adding a cumbersome amount of armor. As a result, the Lorraine 40t contains minimal armor, instead focusing entirely on firepower."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_3_desc:0 "France's first modern tank, the AMX 50 100 is the first French tank of the heavy weight class to receive an autoloader. This results in major improvement to both offensive and defensive combat, making it one of the best tanks. Similarly to its predecessor, the AMX M4 45, this tank favors mobility over armor protection, continuing the French pattern of low armour protection on their "heavy" tanks."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_4:0 "§W§!AMX 30§W§!"
    tank_fra_modern_chassis_4_desc:0 "The AMX-30 continues the French belief that trying to prevent armor penetration by adding additional armor would be too inefficient. Rather, the tank is protected by its small profile and high speed. Similarly to other French tanks of the time, the AMX-30 is a very good tank in terms of combat stats but may prove vulnerable when dealing with capable anti-tank weaponry."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_5:0 "§W§!AMX 50 120§W§!"
    fra_modern_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The AMX 50 120 has a 120mm gun upgraded from 100mm, designed to pierce heavily armored Soviet tanks. Keeping in line with modern French tank doctrine, the AMX 50 120 has very good speed for its weight class. While it armor is by no means weak, its large profile means that it is very easy to be hit by large caliber anti-tank guns that are guaranteed to penetrate it."

It wields a large amount of firepower coming from its two turrets, and its armor is impenetrable by most other tanks. However, these tanks are very expensive to produce, and their abysmal speed may lead to them being outmaneuvered on the battlefield"

Border conflicts with the Soviet Union showed that previous models were ineffective when dealing with anything other than infantry.

    tank_sov_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "The T-26 is designed off of an imported model of the British Vickers 6-ton. The 1933 model mounts a 45mm L46 gun which has an extremely high shell velocity, making this prewar tank the best of its time for piercing enemy armor. Most of these tanks do not have radios, as the few radios in Soviet possession are prioritised for command tanks. This tank also sets a trend with many early war Soviet tanks for being extremely unreliable. \n§RThis is a brand new model and will not retain efficiency§"

The tank has below average combat stats but it is very cheap to produce and can be used effectively in recon companies and anti-infantry attacks. Due to its one man turret, it has reduced breakthrough and defense because the commander is likely to be overwhelmed with tasks on the battlefield.\n§RThis is a brand new model and will not retain efficiency§"

    tank_spr_light_chassis_1:0 "§W§!CCI tipo 37§W§!"
    tank_spr_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "A first foray by Spain into the tank concept, the Tipo 37 is predictably not all too impressive. Its 20mm cannon makes it somewhat useful against infantry, but its slow speed and minimal armour means it is of little use otherwise."

    tank_spr_light_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Verdeja I§W§!"
    tank_spr_light_chassis_2_desc:0 "Mounting a copy of the Soviet 45mm mounted on tanks such as the T-26 and BT-5, the Verdeja I sports an impressively low profile and good armour for a light tank. However, its rear-mounted turret limits gun depression, and it is not all that fast for a light tank."

    tank_spr_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!Verdeja II§W§!"
    tank_spr_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "Ditching the odd rear-mounted turret of its forbear but retaining the low silhouette, the Verdeja II makes improvements in most areas, being faster and more heavily armoured. This allows for excellent breakthrough characteristics, leaving the retention of the old 45mm gun the Verdeja II's only downside."

    tank_spr_medium_chassis_1_desc:0 "Little is known about the Verdeja III, other than the fact that Félix Verdeja Bardales was ordered to cancel its development upon the delivery of Panzer III and IV tanks from Germany. It can thus be assumed that the next step in the Verdeja line was along the lines of a medium tank similar to these earlier Panzers, with distinct features of the Verdeja programme, such as a low profile and sloped armour, being retained."

    tank_hol_light_chassis_2:0 "§W§!CTMS-1TB1§W§!"
    tank_hol_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "Now armed with a 37mm, the CTMS is capable of combatting enemy mechanised divisions, but is of little worth against any heavier armour. Speed takes a hit over the CTLS, but the comparativley enormous boost to all combat stats make it a worthwhile investment over its predecessor"

    tank_hol_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!MTLS-1GI4§W§!"
    tank_hol_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "While the doubling of armour over the CTMS is its most attractive stat, the MTLS is also notable for mounting two of the 37mm cannons used by the CTMS in one turret. This does little for the combat stats of the vehicle while negatively affecting reliability."
