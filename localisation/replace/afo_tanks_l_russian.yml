    tank_fra_light_chassis_1:0 "§W§!Renault FT§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Renault FT lay's the foundation for all future tank designs, having a very reliable and stable build with the standard tank layout. It is however extremely outdated"

    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2:0 "§W§!Renault R35§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2_desc:0 "Support Tank\nThe Renault R35 has decent armor and anti-infantry fighting capabilities to fulfill its infantry support role. However, its gun has extremely poor armor penetration, using the same 37mm gun as the Hotchkiss H35. Additionally, the 2 man crew and lack of radios meant that the tank suffers in the same way most other French tanks did when it came to coordination. It had a single cupola that was rotatable, but has to be hand-cranked by an already overburdened commander."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2_2:0 "§W§!Renault R40§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_2_2_desc:0 "Support Tank\nSimilarly to the Hotchkiss H35, the Renault R35 was deemed to have an insufficient gun. The Renaults R40's L/35 37mm gun is extended for increased armor penetration. Radios are also included the tank, but as is the case for other early war French tanks, the limited crew means that the addition of the radio only serve to increase the workload of the already strained commander, resulting in reduced defensive and breakthrough ability."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!Hotchkiss H35§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Hotchkiss has extremely poor steering when driving across uneven terrain. Its relatively high armor and an L/35 37mm SA38 gun allows it to perform well in an anti-infantry role. The Hotchkiss retains the FT's two man crew layout. Despite this fact, the tank is so small that the crewspace is still extremely cramped, making it even more difficult to focus on matters of battle."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!Hotchkiss H39§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "To achieve higher speeds, the H39 improves upon the H35's engine significantly. The track and suspension are also improved, easing many of the original tank's issues with maneuverability. The tank uses an elongated L/35 37 gun to achieve greater armour penetration. Some tanks are even given radios, but due to their 2 man crew, it is still difficult to use effectively while multitasking."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_4:0 "§W§!AMC 35§W§!"
    fra_light_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The AMC 35 is one of the few French-designed tanks of its time to incorporate a two-man turret. However, this means that the amount of armor on the turret is reduced to make room for the new crew member. Compared to the Hotchkiss 39, this design sacrifices armor for increased speed and breakthrough. However, the lack of radios means that coordination on offensive and defensive operations is still difficult."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_5:0 "§W§!AMX 40§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_support_5_desc:0 "Support Tank\nRather than providing large amounts of firepower, the AMX 40 serves in heavily armoured units that can protect infantry during an offensive. It utilizes a 2-man turret and extensive armor sloping. The tank has no vision slits, so the only way to see out of the tank is a panoramic periscope at the top of the turret.Though the tank is intended to be given a radio, there is no designated radio operator.  Though there are small offensive improvements on the Renault R40, the biggest change was in the large increase in armor plating. "

    tank_fra_light_chassis_6:0 "§W§!AMX 12§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_6_desc:0 "This revolutionary design has an oscillating turret. It's revolver type magazine utilizes autoloaders, allowing the tank to dispense large amounts of firepower. Unfortunately, after firing the tank has to be pulled back to safety because the tank has to be reloaded from outside the vehicle. Its reliable chassis served as the basis for all French light tanks until 1985. It included a radio but did not have a designated radio operator."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_7:0 "§W§!AMX 13 75§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_7_desc:0 "Based off of the prototype AMX 12t design, the AMX 13 75 improves the tank across all areas, incorporating a 75mm SA 50 gun for increased firepower. Compared to other light tanks of the time, it has one of the highest armor values but lower piercing."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_7_2:0 "§W§!AMX 13 90§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_7_2_desc:0 "Continuing on the AMX 13 line, the 90 variant swaps out the 75mm gun for a 90mm F3 medium pressure gun capable of firing high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) shells. Though the transition from the AMX 13 75 to the AMX 13 90 has mostly marginal stat increases, the value for piercing is almost doubled due to the introduction of HEAT shells."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_8:0 "§W§!BC 25t§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_8_desc:0 "The Batignolles-Chatillion Char 25t is an extension of the design introduced in the AMX 13 line, using the same oscillatory turret design and autoloader armament. One key difference from its predecessors is its use of 4 crew members, finally having both a dedicated gunner and radio operator. In many ways, this tank performs more similarly to a medium tank than a light tank. It outshines other light tanks in every single stat, but is much more expensive to produce. When compared to mediums, it has fairly average stats, but is lacking severely in armor protection."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_assault_1:0 "§W§!FT BS§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_assault_1_desc:0 "The Renault FT fitted with a short-barrel Blockhau Schneider 75mm gun. Due to the small size it inherited from the Renault FT, it is not able to fit a dedicated gunner, loader, or radio operator into the vehicle. This lack of manpower and small nature of the turret, makes it extremely difficult to use the gun effectively. This means that, though the BS had a large improvement in soft attack from the original FT, its values for breakthrough and defense are atrocious."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_6:0 "§W§!AMX 105 AM§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_6_desc:0 "The AMX 105 AM fits an accurate and devastating 105mm gun on the chassis of the AMX 12t. However, the recoil has much more force than the small chassis is meant to handle, meaning it is prone to breaking down  or malfunctioning in the field."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7:0 "§W§!AMX 13 AM§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7_desc:0 "Using a 155mm gun on the AMX 13 chassis, this SPG has good soft attack values but suffers from the same issues of its predecessor, as the chassis was not designed to handle the recoil of such a large gun."

    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7_2:0 "§W§!AMX 13 F3§W§!"
    tank_fra_light_chassis_spg_7_2_desc:0 "Using a 155mm gun, the AMX 13 F3 does not provide as much soft attack as some larger SPGs, but it is by no means small. It is very cheap to produce and fixes some of its predecessor's reliability issues, making it worth considering."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Renault D2§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_2_desc:0 "To reduce weight, the Renault D2 uses a novel technique that removes the need for internal girders that would have increased the weight of the vehicle. Unfortunately, this technique makes the construction process extremely complex, resulting in a high production cost for the tank. Additionally, the tank is very unreliable, which only further aggravates its high production cost. A key improvement in the D2 is the addition of a 3rd crew member as a dedicated radio/telegraphy operator."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3:0 "§W§!SOMUA 35§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3_desc:0 "The Somua S35 employs well-sloped, casted armor and simplifies production. Unlike other French tanks, it is designed with AT combat in mind and comes with significant improvements for piercing and mobility. however, anti-infantry capability is left untouched. Considered one of the best tanks of its time, a single-man turret and poor strategic use of the vehicle prevented it from operating at peak effectiveness."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!SOMUA 40§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "The S40 enlarges the cupola originally present in the S35. The novel turret is a welded and placed on top of a redesigned super structure, helping to improve costs and armour protection. Compared to the S35, values such as piercing and speed are largely the same. Due to the improved spotting from the new cupola, this tank has greatly improved breakthrough over its predecessor."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_4:0 "§W§!SOMUA S40 bis§W§!"

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_5:0 "§W§!SARL 42§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_5_desc:0 "The SARL 42 replaces the typical French one-man-turret with one capable of fitting two crew members and a larger gun. This new turret design allows for dedicated crew members for different jobs in the tank. However, the it must be significantly larger to maintain a similar level of armour protection, making the vehicle significantly more costly to produce. It also features an enlarged cupola, making it easier for the commander to spot enemy targets while on offensives, but at the same time making the tank easier to spot."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_6:0 "§W§!Char G1§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_6_desc:0 "The Char G1 is intended to incorporate features such as gun stabilisation, semi-automatic loading, and optical rangefinders. These advancements, along with the introduction of an L/32 75mm gun lead to a significant increase in offensive capability against both infantry and tanks. This tank incorporate a two man turret and allows the commander to aim the gun himself to double as a gunner if he so chooses. This is France's first medium tank that can be considered on-par with the tanks of industrialised majors while still being relatively cheap to produce."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3:0 "§W§!SOMUA S35 CA§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3_desc:0 "Based on the chassis of the Somua S40, the S35 CA replaces the turret with a mounted casemate, allowing it to mount a larger gun capable of piercing enemy tanks. Due to its shape, it earned a nickname as "The Bathtub." The reduced complexity as a result of removing the turret, allows for a cheaper production cost of the tank. While the tank destroyer has reduced breakthrough from its original variant, it excels when destroying tanks due to its elevated piercing and hard attack values."

    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3_2:0 "§W§!SAu 40 (75)§W§!"
    tank_fra_medium_chassis_td_3_2_desc:0 "An average tank destroyer, the 75mm variant of the SaU 40 has piercing and armour values that make it capable in armoured combat. A lack of good vision slots means the TD struggles with its breakthrough and defense values."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_1_desc:0 "Bridging the medium and heavy tank lines together, the AMX M4 45 brings together their maneuverability and combat traits. This sets a trend for future French heavy tanks, as many of them favor their mobility at the cost of relatively low armor protection as a heavy tank. It has excellent combat stats, after incorporating design elements from the German Tiger II tank."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Lorraine 40 90§W§!"
    tank_fra_modern_chassis_2_desc:0 "The Lorraine 40t retains the oscillating turret from the AMX and Bat-Chat tank lines. Due to the advent of hollow charge anti-tank weapons, it is difficult to make a tank impenetrable without adding a cumbersome amount of armor. As a result, the Lorraine 40t contains minimal armor, instead focusing entirely on firepower."

This results in major improvement to both offensive and defensive combat, making it one of the best tanks. Similarly to its predecessor, the AMX M4 45, this tank favors mobility over armor protection, continuing the French pattern of low armour protection on their "heavy" tanks."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_4:0 "§W§!AMX 30§W§!"
    tank_fra_modern_chassis_4_desc:0 "The AMX-30 continues the French belief that trying to prevent armor penetration by adding additional armor would be too inefficient. Rather, the tank is protected by its small profile and high speed. Similarly to other French tanks of the time, the AMX-26 is a very good tank in terms of combat stats but may prove vulnerable when dealing with capable anti-tank weaponry."

    tank_fra_modern_chassis_5:0 "§W§!AMX 50 120§W§!"
    fra_modern_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The AMX 50 120 has a 120mm gun upgraded from 100mm, designed to pierce heavily armored Soviet tanks. Keeping in line with modern French tank doctrine, the AMX 50 120 has very good speed for its weight class. While it armor is by no means weak, its large profile means that it is very easy to be hit by large caliber anti-tank guns that are guaranteed to penetrate it."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_1:0 "§W§!Fiat 3000§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "Modeled after the French Renault FT design, the Fiat 3000 had many of the same issues that the original tank had. Having only two crew members with a one man turret proved to put a large burden on the commander of a tank, leading to confusion and inefficiency. The design and armaments of the tank are already outdated."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_2:0 "§W§!L3§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_2_desc:0 "The L3 is a weakly armored tankette with a machine gun armament only strong enough to fight infantry elements. It was too small to fit any crew other than a commander and gunner. While their breakthrough is helpful for fighting in areas such as Ethiopia and Spain, they are considered inadequate for modern warfare."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!L6 Poto§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "The L6 Prototype is an attempt by the Italian Army to rapidly modernize their severely outdated armor technology. While having decent combat ability for a tank of its size and being a big improvement from the Italian tankettes, the L6 proto is already being surpassed by other majors as it is being developed. While moving to three crew members was an advancement, the tank still had a one man turret, putting an unfair burden on the tank's commander. The tank also had no cupola, limiting its ability to breakthrough or defend properly."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!L6§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "The field implementation of the L6, added on additional armor with little to no change in offensive abilities. The additional armor actually leads to issues with the tank, as the engine could not handle the added weight, causing reliability issues."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_4:0 "§W§!L8§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_4_desc:0 "The L8 implements a 47mm gun and new suspension, providing increased piercing and mobility. However, the tank is by this point, obsolete, and will struggle in combat against any form of competent enemy armour."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_5:0 "§W§!M16§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_5_desc:0 "Inspired by British cruiser tanks encountered in North Africa, the M16 prioritised a sleeker design to achieve higher levels of speed. While the tank is fairly fast, the tank provides little in terms of combat capabilities. The smaller profile does make the tank difficult to spot and hit, making its breakthrough and defense usable traits."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_5_2:0 "§W§!M18§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_5_2_desc:0 "The M18 marks a significant improvement in Italian armour design, doubling on the armour of its predecessor. Though it is by no means an excellent tank, the M18 is able to perform well in the frontlines if well supported."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_6:0 "§W§!M20§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_6_desc:0 "The M20 continues to improve on the 75mm gun to provide the tank with greater offensive prowess. The addition of advanced radios allows for significantly increased coordination on defense and breakthrough, making the crew much more effective in combat."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_td_2_desc:0 "Outfitted with a 33mm gun, this L3 variant has piercing on par with basic anti-tank guns of its time. It can pierce most early war armour, but has very little hard attack, offering little reason to pick this over the standard Italian anti-tank gun."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_td_3:0 "§W§!Semovente da 47 32§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_td_3_desc:0 "The Semovente da 47 32 mounts the anti-tank gun of the same name in an open-top superstructure. While its piercing and armour stats are fairly good, its lacking in others make this vehicle weak in combat. Out of all of these, the most significant barrier to this tank destroyer's success is its terrible reliability."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_td_4:0 "§W§!Semovente da 66 43§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_td_4_desc:0 "The Semovente da 66 43 is extremely outdated and is deficient at piercing anything but very lightly armoured targets. Its light hull is unable to mount the guns needed to fight against armoured units of significant threat."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_spg_3:0 "§W§!Semovente da 47 18§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_spg_3_desc:0 "The Semovente da 47 18 is Italy's first attempt at a self-propelled gun. It is severely outdated in terms of vehicle design, suffering from terrible combat stats, speed, and reliability. Basic Italian artillery is far easier to produce and use compared to this vehicle."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_spg_4:0 "§W§!Semovente da 65 40§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_spg_4_desc:0 "The 65 40 improves significantly on the 47 18, but as is the case for many Italian vehicles, the design is still extremely outdated. Similarly to the 47 18, this vehicle underperforms when compared to the basic Italian artillery of the time, and should seldom be considered a viable option."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_2:0 "§W§!L3 35M§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_2_desc:0 "Only fitted with dual machine guns, this vehicle is only suited to anti-infantry operations and cannot be expected to perform to any degree against capable enemy aircraft. It is also extremely unreliable."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_3:0 "§W§!Anti aria da 20§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_3_desc:0 "Equipped with a rapid firing 20mm can, this vehicle is better at anti-aircraft operations than the L3 35M, but it is still very ineffective."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_4:0 "§W§!Anti aria da duello 20§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_4_desc:0 "Retaining the 20mm autocannons in dual form, the da duello 20 incorporates a larger turret that provides greatly increased anti-infantry and anti-air capabilities. However, by now, heavier forms of self-propelled anti-air exist and are much more proficient in this role rendering this vehicle line obsolete."

    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_5:0 "§W§!Anti aria da quad 20§W§!"
    tank_ita_light_chassis_aa_5_desc:0 "Improvements in hull and turret design allow the vehicle crew to coordinate in defense and breakthroughs. To increase mobility, excess armour was removed in non-essential areas."



    tank_ita_medium_chassis_1:0 "§W§!M11§W§!"
    tank_ita_medium_chassis_1_desc:0 "The M11 is Italy's first attempt at a true medium tank. Though it contains a turret, it is too small to fit the main armament and it must be placed within the hull. The driver and gunner duties have also been combined in a single role, preventing either from being performed optimally. This tank is severely outdated and will struggle to compete against any form of competent armour."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_1_2:0 "§W§!M13§W§!"
    tank_ita_medium_chassis_1_2_desc:0 "The M13 is built on the chassis of the M11 with significant changes to the overall design. The turret has been expanded to house an improved 47mm cannon that makes the M13 much better than its predecessor. However, its armour is held together by rivets and is very thin. While a large improvement on the M11, many more changes need to be made to prevent this tank line from becoming obsolete."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_1_3:0 "§W§!M15§W§!"
    tank_ita_medium_chassis_1_3_desc:0 "Designed as a stopgap until heavier tanks such as the P26 are ready, the M15 has an elongated version of the 47mm gun, improved armour, and improved reliability. As is this case with preceding Italian tanks, these tanks are still severely outdated and struggle against anything heavier than a light tank."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_td_1_desc:0 "The 75 34 came equipped with a 75mm L/34 gun and improved on several aspects of the 47 32. While still nowhere close to being an excellent tank destroyer, it is good enough at piercing most enemy tanks that you will find in Africa."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_td_1_2:0 "§W§!Semovente da 90 53§W§!"
    tank_ita_medium_chassis_td_1_2_desc:0 "Prompted by demand for better anti-tank capabilities for the Italian expeditionary force fighting in the Soviet Union, a 90/53 heavy anti-aircraft gun has been placed into an open-turreted tank destroyer. Due to its large gun, it able to pierce almost every single tank it encounters; however, its design has non-existant armour and is very fragile. It is also unreliable because the chassis was not intended for such a large gun."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_td_2:0 "§W§!Semovente da 75 46§W§!"
    tank_ita_medium_chassis_td_2_desc:0 "This vehicle is an extension of the Semovente da 75 34, providing an all around to every combat stat. It is very difficult for this tank destroyer to reliably pierce enemy units, as it is very outdated by this point."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_spg_1_desc:0 "The Semovente da 149 is a completely unprotected self-propelled gun. While this means it has essentially no armour protection, it is able to fit a very powerful gun. In terms of only offensive power, it is one of the few Italian designs that can be considered good."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_assault_1_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nTaking inspiration from the extremely successful German Stug III design, the Italians wanted to design a vehicle of similar calibre. The Semovente da 75 18 is equipped with a modern 75mm L/18 gun. While it fails to meet the standards of its origin in the Stug III, it is a well-designed vehicle, only held back by the engineering capabilities of Italy."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_aa_1_desc:0 "Equipped with 4 specially modified 20mm autocannons, the 20/70 quadruplo is a very effective anti-aircraft vehicle. When compared to other self-propelled anti-air guns, it has a respectively high amount of armour. For that reason, it is also slightly more expensive to produce than most models."

    tank_ita_medium_chassis_aa_3_desc:0 "While this vehicle provides many upgrades over the anti aria da quad 20, it is severely lacking in anti-air capability, which is its designated role. Despite being much heavier, it still retains the mobility of its predecessor."

    tank_ita_modern_chassis_3_desc:0 "Another improvement to anti-tank capability makes it possible for this tank to fight some of the major nations main battle tanks. While the tank is relatively fast, it must do so by compromising on its armour, which is still far below average."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_1:0 "§W§!Sokosha§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "Also known as the Type 92 Heavy Armoured Car, the Sokosha is a cavalry tank designed for scouting and infantry support. Only equipped with machine guns, the tank is only suited to fight infantry. It should not be expected to be able to fight on its own, as it is very lightly armored and can be pierced by infantry without towed gun support. It is also extremely unreliable and prone to breaking down."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Otsu Gata Sensha§W§!"

    tank_jap_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!Ha-Go§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "This light tank was designed to support motorised infantry in combined arms warfare. It has a Type 94 37mm tank gun capable of piercing very light armor; however, it is not designed for this purpose and is supposed to be used in breaking through lines of infantry to support an advance. Due to the crew setup, the commander is susceptible to being overwhelmed by tasks. The tanks also lacked radios and made use of flag signals to communicate between tanks during battle, making it difficult to use the tank effectively."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!Ha-Go Kai§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "The later version of the Ha Go incorporates a newer Type 98 37mm gun for increased anti-tank prowess and a radio antennae to better coordinate offensives. Despite this, this tank is inferior to almost every other major's light tanks of the time and is only suited for fighting inferior enemies in China."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_3_3:0 "§W§!Ke-Nu§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_3_3_desc:0 "The Type 4 Ke-Nu is a refitted Ha Go tank with the turret of a Chi Ha. While breakthrough capabilities are improved against lines of infantry, the turret of a medium tank being placed onto the hull of a light tank significantly weighed down the vehicle with marginal improvements to armour protection."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_4:0 "§W§!Ke-Ni§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_4_desc:0 "The Ke Ni features thicker, sloped armour and an improved engine. Its higher piercing lets it fight other light tanks it might find in the Pacific, but it cannot be expected to match medium tanks."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_4_2:0 "§W§!Ke-To§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_4_2_desc:0 "The Ke To is based on the Ke Ni, using the same engine and suspension, but using a significantly enlarged turret to house an improved 37mm cannon. While piercing is improved, the change is likely too little to make a significant difference. By now, the gun is too outdated to pierce many light tanks."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_5:0 "§W§!Ke-Ho§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_5_desc:0 "The Ke Ho combines the Chi Ha's turret and and Ke Ni's hull. This large turret provides ample room for an updated gun and larger crew, leading to greatly improved breakthrough and piercing. It should be noted that this tank is only designed as a stopgap and can only reliably fight light armor."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_5_2:0 "§W§!Ke-Ho Kai§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_5_2_desc:0 "In an effort to extend the usefulness of Japanese light tanks, an improved gun and armour scheme were installed onto the Ke Ho model. The tank and the rest of its line continues to grow obsolete."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_td_3_desc:0 "The Ho Ru presents a fairly cheap option for armoured anti-tank. With only the same piercing as the Type 1 47mm anti-tank gun of the same time period, the Ho Ru should only be expected to handle poorly equipped armour units in China. Due to its weak armour, it is susceptible to counter attacks from enemy armour."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_td_5:0 "§W§!Ho-He§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_td_5_desc:0 "The Ho He makes slight upgrades on the preceding Ho Ru tank destroyer. But because it a light tank destroyer, it is difficult to equip enough firepower or armour to keep it relevant."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_spg_3:0 "§W§!Ho-To§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_spg_3_desc:0 "The Ho To doesn't provide the largest amount of firepower, but it is a well-rounded vehicle. It provides an excellent amount of defense while being maneuverable and cheap to produce. However, it is very fragile and should be kept out of harm's way from enemy armoured units."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_spg_5:0 "§W§!Ku-Se§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_spg_5_desc:0 "Armed with a 75mm gun, the Ku-Se only contains minimal frontal armour and an open case mate. In almost every way, it is weaker than its predecessor, the Ho-To, which was already outdated when it was first produced."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_aa_1:0 "§W§!Ki-To§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_aa_1_desc:0 "The Ki To uses a 20mm autocannon to increase anti-air capabilities. Due to overall turret and armament design, the tank is very ineffective at shooting down enemy aircraft. It still retains all the anti-infantry capability of its parent tank, which admittedly, is still very little."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_aa_4:0 "§W§!Ta-Se§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_aa_4_desc:0 "The Ta Se improves the anti-air weapons but still retains the firing crew within a constrained turret, making it difficult to locate and target enemy aircraft. As a result, no improvement to anti-air capabilities is observed."

    tank_jap_light_chassis_aa_4_2:0 "§W§!Ta-Se AAG§W§!"
    tank_jap_light_chassis_aa_4_2_desc:0 "The Ta Se AAG removes the turret of the Ta-Se and replaces it with an elevated platform to contain the dual 20mm autocannons. The chassis used in this vehicle is too small to be used as a firing platform, and combat effectiveness suffers as a result. While the gun is much more capable at shooting down enemy aircraft, it is very far behind in terms of technology."



    tank_jap_medium_chassis_1:0 "§W§!I-Go§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_1_desc:0 "The Yi-Go (I-Go) is armed with a short-barrel 57mm gun designed for destroying emplaced infantry formations. Despite being only very thinly armoured, the tank hull is bulky and forces its speed to a crawl. The tank is outdated and must be updated to fight in a modern war."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_2:0 "§W§!Chi-Ni§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_2_desc:0 "The Chi Ni is viewed as a lighter and cheaper alternative to the Chi Ha. Due to its smaller size, it could only retain a three-man crew which led to significant shortcomings in combat. Additionally, despite being the lighter variant, its weaker engine means that it is still slower than the Chi-Ha."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_3:0 "§W§!Chi-Ha§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_3_desc:0 "Using combat experience from China and Siberia, it was determined that the Yi-Go is too slow to keep up with motorised infantry elements. While it uses the same 57mm gun, the Chi Ni makes massive strides in tank design, adding an improved cupola, radios, engine,  and armor scheme. Combat against enemy armour should be avoided where possible."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!Chi-Ha Kai§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "Incorporating the same specially designed 47mm gun used in the Chi Ho, the later variant of the Chi Ha proved much more capable at handling enemy armoured units. It also expanded the turret, allowing for three crew members to fit inside the area."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_4:0 "§W§!Chi-Ho§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_4_desc:0 "In the process of designing this medium tank, heavy emphasis was placed on a gun capable of piercing enemy tanks. Border conflicts with the Soviet Union showed that previous models were ineffective when dealing with anything other than infantry. Along with an innovative 47mm gun, this was the first Japanese tank to utilize hydraulic systems in steering, improving the mobility of the vehicle. One glaring weakness in this tank is that it is very lightly armoured."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_5:0 "§W§!Chi-He§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_5_desc:0 "The Chi He is the first Japanese tank to have a radio as standard equipment across all units, leading to improved defense and breakthrough. The tank uses the same 47mm as the Chi Ho and Chi Ha Kai. While this tank model adds a considerable amount of armour, it is still too thin to protect against other medium tanks."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_5_2:0 "§W§!Chi-Nu§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_5_2_desc:0 "The Chi Nu is designed as a stopgap until sufficient number of the Chi To can be produced and sent into combat. To accomplish this task, it is designed with a 75mm gun capable of piercing American medium armour. While the overall armour scheme, chassis, and suspension was identical to the Chi He, the Chi Nu had an enlarged turret to fit the new gun and three crew members."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_6:0 "§W§!Chi-To§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_6_desc:0 "The Chi To demonstrates the largest stride in Japanese armour technology during the war. The tank is significantly larger than all of its predecessors and is able to fit a crew of 5 members. With upgraded armor, a 75mm gun, and an improved engine, the Chi To is an extremely effective tank. It should be noted that these changes come at an increased production cost."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_7:0 "§W§!Chi-Ri§W§!"
    tank_jap_medium_chassis_7_desc:0 "The Chi Ri is intended to not only match allied armour in the Pacific, but to also surpass it. In order to fit the larger turret and its improved gun, the hull of the Chi To has been extended. While this means that the firepower of the tank could be improved, sacrifices to armour need to be made to prevent the vehicle from being weighed down."

    tank_jap_medium_chassis_td_5_desc:0 "The Ho Nu is almost an exact copy of its predecessor, but increases the amount hardness on the vehicle due to the replacement of an open-top case mate with a closed turret. However, this does lead to increased production costs."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_1_desc:0 "The T26 is designed off of an imported model of the British Vickers 6-ton. The 1933 model mounts a 45mm L46 gun which has an extremely high shell velocity, making this prewar tank the best of its time for piercing enemy armor. Most of these tanks do not have radios, as the few radios in Soviet possession are prioritised for command tanks. This tank also sets a trend with many early war Soviet tanks for being extremely unreliable."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_1_2:0 "§W§!T 26 (38)§W§!"
    tank_sov_light_chassis_1_2_desc:0 "Drawing on experience from Far East border conflicts and the Spanish Civil War, the 1938 model of the T26 includes a new conical turret that is more sturdier and less likely to be penetrated. While it makes some improvement from the 1933 variant and is still able to pierce enemy tanks reliably, it lags woefully behind other tanks in almost every statistic."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_2:0 "§W§!T 60§W§!"
    tank_sov_light_chassis_2_desc:0 "The T-60 is a light tank designed for a recon role. It is equipped with a 20mm TNSh autocannon only capable of fighting lightly armored infantry units. The tank has below average combat stats but it is very cheap to produce and can be used effectively in recon companies and anti-infantry attacks. Due to its one man turret, it has reduced breakthrough and defense because the commander is likely to be overwhelmed with tasks on the battlefield."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_2_2:0 "§W§!T 70§W§!"
    tank_sov_light_chassis_2_2_desc:0 "The T 70 is intended to replace the T 50 in infantry support and the T 60 in reconnaissance roles. Using a 45mm gun, it has significantly improved piercing, but it unlikely to be effective against anything other than lightly armoured targets. It also incorporates sloped armour, allowing this tank to be more heavily armoured than many of its light counterparts. It still has a one man turret which may pose an issue for the commander when trying to conduct the tank."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_2_3_desc:0 "A later variant of the T 70, the T 80 introduces a two man turret with little other changes. By this time in the war, light tanks are largely obsolete as they struggle fighting enemy armour or well-equipped infantry. They are typically only used for reconnaissance."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_3:0 "§W§!T 50§W§!"
    tank_sov_light_chassis_3_desc:0 "The T 50 employs the use of a novel armour scheme, using well-sloped and entirely welded armour. This results in a high level of armor for a light tank without a heavy increase in weight. All T50 tanks have radios and a cupola for commander, which are excellent features not usually present in other Soviet tank designs. It is very good at fighting other enemy light tanks due to its high piercing and armor."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_4_desc:0 "The Pt 76 is an amphibious light tank that serves as a fire support platform and reconnaissance vehicle.

    tank_sov_light_chassis_assault_2_desc:0 "Assault Gun\nDespite being armed with a Zis-3 76mm anti-tank gun, the SU 76 can serve as a multipurpose vehicle. Its gun is able to fire armor piercing and high explosive rounds, and it can do large amounts of damage to infantry and armoured units. Some issues with the tank are its low armour and somewhat low reliability. However, it is very cheap to produce and can be easily replaced."

    tank_sov_light_chassis_spg_1_desc:0 "In the 1930s, it was determined that towed artillery pieces did not have the mobility necessary to keep up with advancing armies. The Su-5-1 is equipped with a 76mm cannon. Typical of most early light SPG's, the gun size causes reliability issues for the light chassis' weak frame. Additionally, such vehicles are usually only lightly armoured, only protecting against small arms fire and shell fragments."

All tanks have a radio and a very high amount of firepower, allowing them to fight many tanks that were developed in more advanced periods. However, it is very expensive to produce and had an unreliable suspension. Due to its complexity, it is very difficult to make incremental modifications to the vehicle, hence why no further tech trees branch off of this vehicle."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_2_desc:0 "More akin to a light tank, the BT series is a tank line predicated on speed and mobility while being lightly armoured. It excels at breaking through defensive lines if used correctly. Its 45mm gun allows it to pierce enemy tanks, but its low armor means it is susceptible to even handheld infantry anti-tank weapons."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_2_2:0 "§W§!BT 7§W§!"
    tank_sov_medium_chassis_2_2_desc:0 "The BT 7 makes marginal improvements on the offensive stats of the BT 5. It includes a new turret with sloped armor to minimize the cost in weight. As such, it has vastly increased speed to the point of being able to keep up with motorized units."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3:0 "§W§!T 34 (40)§W§!"
    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_desc:0 "The primary workhorse of the Soviet Armoured Corps, the T34 is a cheap, yet extremely combat effective vehicle. Its novel use of sloped armor gave it extremely good protection without a massive reduction in speed. It is very difficult for contemporary vehicles to penetrate this vehicle without the use of dedicated anti-tank units. Due to issues in manufacturing, there are some issues with reliability in this vehicle."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_2:0 "§W§!T 34 (41)§W§!"
    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_2_desc:0 "This variant of the T34 includes an improved F34 gun and radio sets for tanks, improving anti-tank combat and breakthrough coordination. Advancements in manufacturing have slightly improved production costs and reliability."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_3:0 "§W§!T 34 (42)§W§!"
    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_3_desc:0 "This variant of the T34 has an updated hexagonal turret which is less cramped and allows for improved combat ability of the crew members. By now the T34 is able to operated effectively when used in large numbers. While still cheap to produce, its armor and piercing is not likely to be helpful against heavier enemy armour models."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_4:0 "§W§!T 34 (85)§W§!"
    tank_sov_medium_chassis_3_4_desc:0 "The T34 85 includes the most major change made to any T34 model of the war, equipping it with an 85mm gun and a new turret to house it in. While a greatly needed improvement to anti-tank capabilities, it is only effective against medium armour and below. It is not a reliable deterrent to heavier armour models.

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_td_3_2_desc:0 "While T34's and KV-1's were more than capable of dealing with the German medium panzers, the incursion of the Tiger tank resulted in the need for dedicated anti-tank units. The SU-85 is equipped with a 85mm D-5T gun and is able to deal with such heavy tanks, albeit only under specific conditions. The tank itself has good armour, is easy to produce, and has good defense."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_td_3_3:0 "§W§!SU 100§W§!"
    tank_sov_medium_chassis_td_3_3_desc:0 "Due to the T34-85 design being able to wield the 85mm gun, the SU-85 is now obsolete and should be improved to better counter armoured threats. The addition of a commander subsection and a new cupola significantly improves crew capability. The new 100mm D-10S was able to easily pierce Tiger and Panther tanks where the SU-85 would sometimes be inconsistent. The tank is still very cheap to produce."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_infantry_support_2_desc:0 "Infantry Support Gun\nThe BT 7a comes with a 76mm KT-type gun, making it very effective at fighting infantry units. To fit the gun, the BT 7a's turret has to be significantly enlarged from the original model. The added weight leads to significantly reduced speed, which is the defining trait of the BT line. As is the case with most assault guns, soft attack values are very good, but it comes at a cost to breakthrough."

    tank_sov_medium_chassis_assault_3_desc:0 "Heavy Assault Gun\nSimilar to its cousin, the SU 76, the 122 howitzer on the SU 122 can serve in multiple roles. It can be used to destroy infantry units and emplacements while still having enough piercing to deal with armour elements. It is much more expensive to produce than the SU 76, but it is also significantly more armoured."




    tank_sov_modern_chassis_1:0 "§W§!T 44§W§!"
    tank_sov_modern_chassis_1_desc:0 "The first major departure from the T34 line, the T44 has major improvements to armour while still retaining its predecessor's mobility. Using an extended 85mm gun, it is able to effectively duel the tanks of any major nation. Despite the amount of additional upgrades provided, it is still relatively cheap to produce."

    tank_sov_modern_chassis_1_2:0 "§W§!T 44 100§W§!"
    tank_sov_modern_chassis_1_2_desc:0 "This variant replaces the 85mm with a 100mm cannon, drastically improving the combat capabilities of the tank. It also provided a hull-mounted MG as a form of anti-infantry protection. This does slow down the tank slightly due to the extra weight."

    tank_sov_modern_chassis_2:0 "§W§!T 54-1§W§!"
    tank_sov_modern_chassis_2_desc:0 "The T54-1 is very similar to the preceding T-34 85 and T-44 100. It has a similar to the T-34 85 but uses the same 100mm gun present in the T-44. The most significant upgrade is to the tanks armour and transmission."

    tank_eng_medium_chassis_aa_4_desc:0 "The Centaur AA does not provide any additional offensive capabilities over the Crusader anti-air line that it is a descendant of. To better deal with anti-armour threats, it has had a significant increase in armour. However, it is still very likely to get pierced, even by infantry-portable anti-tank weapons. The lack of improved armament may also cause issues when trying to deal with enemy aircraft."
