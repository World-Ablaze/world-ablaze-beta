  # General Localisation
  light_mg_desc:0 "Rifle-calibre machine guns gives little added firepower against air targets for a very moderate cost. They quickly become outdated against newer armoured airplanes."

  heavy_mg_desc:0 "Heavy machine guns are a considerable improvement over lighter guns, providing enough firepower to contest against modern armoured airplanes."

  aircraft_cannon_desc:0 "Automatic cannons offer a significant amount of firepower against air and ground targets at considerable cost in weight."

	upwards_cannon_desc:0 "Upward-firing autocannons allow an interceptor aircraft to engage bombers from the safety of staying outside the fire field of the bomber's defensive arsenal."

  engine_cannon_desc:0 "Certain engine designs leave enough inside the engine hub for a cannon to be able to fire directly through the propeller shaft. Such placement provides the most optimal placement for delivering accurate firepower."

  gun_pod_desc:0 "External pods attached to the wings in order to provide housing for additional guns with immense firepower. The extra weight and added drag, however, can be detrimental to underpowered aircraft."

	machinegun_turret_desc:0 "While somewhat underpowered for air-to-air combat, a light machine gun in a turret will make any attack against this plane a more dangerous undertaking."

	heavy_machinegun_turret_desc:0 "A heavy machine gun in a rotating turret allows the defender to fight back against a fighter armed with similar weapons with some hope of success."

	cannon_turret_desc:0 "A modern cannon in a traversable turret significantly alters the balance of power between the defender and the attacker in air combat. Few fighters can withstand a direct hit from a modern cannon and continue to fight."

	remote_controlled_turret_desc:0 "Using novel engineering solutions, the gunners could operate a gun turret remotely from more protected positions inside the plane, as well as being able to man more guns with less gunners."

	ground_rockets_desc:0 "Unguided projectiles hung under the wings. Since they are fired ahead of the attacking plane, it is a lot easier for the pilot to aim them at the target compared to bombs."

	at_rockets_desc:0 "Unguided projectiles hung under the wings. The warhead is specially designed to penetrate the hardened armour of tanks, making it a lot more effective in ground attacks compared to bombs."

	air_rockets_desc:0 "Unguided projectiles hung under the wings. Designed as anti-bomber weapons, they still pack enough explosive power to hurt ground targets."

	bomb_locks_he_desc:0 "Mountings for bombs under the wings or the fuselage allow the plane to attack ground targets with some hope of success."

	bomb_locks_gp_desc:0 "Mountings for bombs under the wings or the fuselage allow the plane to attack ground and naval targets with some hope of success."

	bomb_bay_he_desc:0 "A bay allows carrying enough ordinance to strike a wide variety of ground targets. Being inside the fuselage reduces drag."

	bomb_bay_gp_desc:0 "A bay allows carrying enough ordinance to strike a wide variety of ground and naval targets. Being inside the fuselage reduces drag."

  water_cooled_engines_desc:0 "Inline engines generally provide a lot of power for their size and weight. However, the cooling systems makes them more susceptible to damage."

  air_cooled_engines_desc:0 "Radial engines are bulkier and heavier but they are more compact. The reliance on just air for cooling makes them able to sustain a lot of punishment and still keep running."

	jet_engines_desc:0 "With a completely different approach to powering an airplane, this complex and temperamental engine offers a large increase in thrust and speed."

	rocket_engines_desc:0 "Utilizing a number of very volatile fuels and a similarly unstable oxidizer, this engine is capable of putting out a very large amount of thrust to propel a plane to high speeds, at the cost of range."

	torpedo_mounting_desc:0 "Hardpoints to allow a torpedo to be mounted under the fuselage. This gives the plane a potent weapon to use against enemy ships."

	anti_ship_guided_bomb_desc:0 "Effectively an anti-ship bomb with radio guidance, this new weapon of war is a serious threat to all ships currently afloat."

	kinetic_torpedo_desc:0 "Lacking an engine, the torpedo relies on the kinetic energy gained from the plane throwing it near the target with a dive. With the fuse set to detonate under the waterline, it presents a substantial danger to unsuspecting ships."
