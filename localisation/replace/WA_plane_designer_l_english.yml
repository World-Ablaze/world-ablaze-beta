  # General Localisation
  light_mg_desc:0 "Rifle-calibre machine guns gives little added firepower against air targets for a very moderate cost. They quickly become outdated against newer armoured airplanes."

  heavy_mg_desc:0 "Heavy machine guns are a considerable improvement over lighter guns, providing enough firepower to contest against modern armoured airplanes."

  aircraft_cannon_desc:0 "Automatic cannons offer a significant amount of firepower against air and ground targets at considerable cost in weight."

  engine_cannon_desc:0 "Certain engine designs leave enough inside the engine hub for a cannon to be able to fire directly through the propeller shaft. Such placement provides the most optimal placement for delivering accurate firepower."

  gun_pod_desc:0 "External pods attached to the wings in order to provide housing for additional guns with immense firepower. The extra weight and added drag, however, can be detrimental to underpowered aircraft."

  water_cooled_engines_desc:0 "Inline engines generally provide a lot of power for their size and weight. However, the cooling systems makes them more susceptible to damage."

  air_cooled_engines_desc:0 "Radial engines are bulkier and heavier but they are more compact. The reliance on just air for cooling makes them able to sustain a lot of punishment and still going."

	torpedo_mounting_desc:0 "Hardpoints to allow a torpedo to be mounted under the fuselage. This gives the plane a potent weapon to use against enemy ships."
