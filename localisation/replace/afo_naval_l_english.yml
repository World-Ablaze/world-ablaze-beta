  ita_frigate_hull_4:0 "Palestro Class"
  ita_frigate_hull_4_desc:0 "The Palestro Class torpedo boat, similarly to other Italian frigates are cheap and fragile ships with limited combat capabilities but can be produced in large numbers. It is faster and has better guns when compared to the Generali, but only by a minute margin."
  ita_frigate_hull_5:0 "Curtatone Class"
  ita_frigate_hull_5_desc:0 "The Curtatone Class warships were the first designs to employ dual-mounted weapons. This allowed more, but smaller guns to be used on the ship. It features improved anti-aircraft guns capable of screening the fleet from aerial targets."
  ita_frigate_hull_6:0 "Spica Class"
  ita_frigate_hull_6_desc:0 "Due to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, the Spica Class was designed to be a weight class that was allowed to be produced in unlimited numbers. It is lighter and weaker compared to its predecessor in most regards, but it does feature decent anti-aircraft weapons."
  ita_frigate_hull_7:0 "Ariete Class"
  ita_frigate_hull_7_desc:0 "§YMain battery can be swapped for ASW§!\nThe Ariete is an enlarged version of the Spica Class designed with escort duties in mind. As a result, its primary weapons are significantly weaker but features improved torpedoes and depth charges. Detection capabilities against surface and sub-surface targets have received significant improvements due to the introduction of dedicated radar and sonar systems."
  ita_frigate_hull_8:0 "Verona Class"
  ita_frigate_hull_8_desc:0 "The Verona is specially designed to counter enemy submarines with its excellent depth charges and sonar systems. Similarly to other frigates, it will not perform well against enemy surface vessels."

  ita_destroyer_hull_1:0 "Mirabello Class"
  ita_destroyer_hull_1_desc:0 "Originally designated as scout cruisers when they were first built during World War I, the Mirabello class is a heavily outdated ship. However, it is one of the few prewar destroyers that includes both torpedo tubes and depth charge launchers."
  ita_destroyer_1:0 "Mirabello Class"
  ita_destroyer_hull_2:0 "Leone Class"
  ita_destroyer_hull_2_desc:0 "The Leone Class is better than the Mirabello in combat in almost every way while still being cheaper to produce. Due to inefficient fuel usage, its operating range is sorely limited."
  ita_destroyer_hull_3:0 "Sella Class"
  ita_destroyer_hull_3_desc:0 "The Sella class destroyers are small and fragile ships that are lacking in many areas. Their sole advantage lies in their low production cost. It is best used to secure local naval superiority in far-reaching overseas colonies."
  ita_destroyer_hull_4:0 "Sauro Class"
  ita_destroyer_hull_4_desc:0 "The Sauro is an enlarged and improved version of the Sella. Similarly to its predecessor, it will suffer in most direct engagements but can be used in small engagements where superior numbers may matter."
  ita_destroyer_hull_5:0 "Navigatori Class"
  ita_destroyer_hull_5_desc:0 "Designed to combat the large French destroyers such as the Chacal and Guepard, the Navigatori were upgunned significantly from previous designs.

  jap_destroyer_hull_4_desc:0 "The Fubuki is Japan's first modern destroyer, featuring significantly improved torpedoes, anti-air, and operational range. It is able to accomplish all of this while still being relatively affordable. It does have a glaring weakness in its inability to detect and engage submarines effectively."
  jap_destroyer_hull_5:0 "Hatsuharu Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_5_desc:0 "Due to restriction by the Washington Naval Treaty, ships of the size of the Fubuki are no longer allowed to be produced in large numbers. The Hatsuharu Class is a cheaper but effective alternative. Though its torpedoes are weaker, its primary guns are very good when compared to most contemporary destroyers."
  jap_destroyer_hull_6:0 "Shiratsuyu Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_6_desc:0 "Designed as a modification to the Hatsuharu Class, the Shiratsuyu retains its predecessors firepower while making significant improvements to torpedo capabilities, making it one of the most powerful destroyer classes of the time. Similarly to all of its predecessors, it does not contain any submarine countermeasures."
  jap_destroyer_hull_7:0 "Asashio Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_7_desc:0 "Following the abandonment of the London Naval Treaty, our glorious nation is no longer limited in its ability to produce powerful warships. The Asashio is designed to be an offensive vessel like its predecessor but with improved range and speed, allowing us to secure control on further reaches of the Pacific."
  jap_destroyer_hull_8:0 "Kagero Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_8_desc:0 "The Kagero, similarly to the Asashio, is unmatched by most other contemporary destroyers in terms of sheer combat capability. It also features improvements to submarine detection and anti-aircraft capabilities. However, it still lacks effective depth charges."
  jap_destroyer_hull_9:0 "Yugumo Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_9_desc:0 "The Yugumo is a repeat design of the Kagero with improved sonar and radar capabilities, greatly improving the scouting and fire targetting capacities of the warship. However, it still lacks any meaningful depth charge weapons, meaning it will still struggle in dealing with enemy submarines."
  jap_destroyer_hull_10:0 "Akizuki Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_10_desc:0 "Utilizing dual purpose batteries, the Akizuki is able to achieve achieve high levels of firepower and anti-air. While its anti-air is a significant improvement over its predecessor, it is still low when compared to that of the American destroyers. It is the first of our destroyers to feature improved depth charges."
  jap_destroyer_hull_11:0 "Matsu Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_11_desc:0 "The Matsu Class is distinct from most other Japanese destroyers in that this ship was primarily designed for escort duties. As a result, it is far cheaper and can be produced in larger numbers but is weaker across almost all aspects."
  jap_destroyer_hull_12:0 "Shimakaze Class"
  jap_destroyer_hull_12_desc:0 "The Shimakaze foregoes the need for main gun armaments and is instead equipped with 15 torpedo tubes capable of inflicting massive amount of damage to enemy ships. It also has extremely high speed and strong anti-air weapons, but it comes at a hefty production cost."

However, it is extremely effective at detecting enemy vessels and is equipped with extremely powerful depth charges capable of evaporating enemy submarines. it is one of the best convoy escort ships"
  eng_frigate_hull_9:0 "River Class"
  eng_frigate_hull_9_desc:0 "The River Class is a step up from the hunt, making improvements to depth charges and anti-aircraft guns to help protect against a huge variety of enemy threats. It also has a very high operational range and speed, allowing it to hunt submarines or escort ships in the vast reaches of our empire."
  eng_frigate_hull_10:0 "Loch Class"
  eng_frigate_hull_10_desc:0 "The Loch Class frigate is an advanced ship built off of years of experience in anti-submarine warfare. Similar to previous designs, it has minimal firepower in favor of depth charges and anti-aircraft guns. It has the most effective depth charges of any ship and should primarily be used as an escort vessel due to the lower speed."
  eng_frigate_hull_11:0 "Type 15 Class"
  eng_frigate_hull_11_desc:0 "The Type 15 has almost the same depth charges as the Loch but regains its speed and makes further improvments to weaponry and strength. It is expensive for a frigate but is well worth the cost."

  eng_destroyer_hull_1:0 "V/W Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_1_desc:0 "The V and W Class ships date back to World War I, and are weak compared to most other ships of this time. For a cheap cost, it has a high operating range, allowing to protect distant areas of our vast colonial empire. It's high anti-air also allows it to protect from enemy aircraft."
  eng_destroyer_1:0 "V/W Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_2:0 "Shakespeare Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_2_desc:0 "The Shakespeare or Thornycroft Class has a much better main armament than the V and W Class but lacks the same effectiveness anti-aircraft fire. Its most important change is the introduction of depth charges, allowing it to protect against enemy submarines."
  eng_destroyer_hull_3:0 "A/B/C/D Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_3_desc:0 "The A/B/C/D Classes feature greatly improved operational range, greater than any other destroyer from any nation. Upgrades to torpedoes also allow these ships to threaten larger enemy vessels at a cheap price."
  eng_destroyer_hull_4:0 "E/F/G/H Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_4_desc:0 "The E/F/G/H Classes are similar to their immediate predecessors with exception to their slightly weaker main guns and cheaper cost. "
  eng_destroyer_hull_5:0 "I Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_5_desc:0 "Keeping in line with the strengths and weaknesses of the British destroyers, the I Class focuses on torpedoes and range rather than its main guns. Improvements to the vessel's depth charges allow it to handle enemy submarines more effectively.  "
  eng_destroyer_hull_6:0 "Tribal Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_6_desc:0 "The Tribal Class is an exception to previous British designs, as it has more of a focus on firepower than torpedoes. It also sacrifices some of its depth charges to fit on more anti-aircraft guns."
  eng_destroyer_hull_7:0 "J/K/N Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_7_desc:0 "The J/K/N Classes have been able to combine the firepower and torpedoes between previous designs and the Tribal, resulting in an effective destroyer that does come at an increased cost of production."
  eng_destroyer_hull_8:0 "L/M Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_8_desc:0 "The signature feature of the L and M Class destroyers are their heavier anti-aircraft armaments. Small improvement have also been made to combat capabilities and ASW with some sacrifice to torpedoes. Nonetheless this is a very effective destroyer in any role."
  eng_destroyer_hull_9:0 "Q/R Class"
  eng_destroyer_hull_9_desc:0 "The Q and R Classes of destroyers sacrifices combat effectiveness in exchange for large improvements to anti-submarine capabilities. They retain there torpedoe's to help against surface raiders, but these ships are best suited as submarine hunters."
  eng_destroyer_hull_10:0 "S/T Class"

  eng_battleship_hull_1:0 "Revenge Class"
  eng_battleship_hull_1_desc:0 "Despite being built after the Queen Elizabeth class, the revenge ships were a comparative downgrade compared to their predecessors, most notably being 3 knots slower. This was motivated by cost-cutting, as the Dreadnought race had already begun to take it's toll."
  eng_battleship_hull_2:0 "Queen Elizabeth Class"
  eng_battleship_hull_2_desc:0 "Arguably the first class of Fast Battleships, the type that would succeed the Superdreadnought, the Queen Elizabeth class were a rejection of the compromise of the battlecruiser, which exchanged armour for speed. The Queen Elizabeth class was therefore able to give and take punishment in a brawl with a fellow battleship, while being able to outrun and outmanoeuvre them. With refits, this keeps the Queen Elizabeth class useful well into WW2."
  eng_battleship_hull_3:0 "Nelson Class"
  eng_battleship_hull_3_desc:0 "When the projected N3 class battleship became illegal under the Washington Naval Treaty, it was redesigned into Nelson class. Peculiarly armed with all three of its turrets forward of its superstructure, the Nelson class is unlike any other battleship to set sail. Nonetheless, its 16 inch guns are not to be trifled with."
  eng_battleship_hull_4:0 "King George V Class"
  eng_battleship_hull_4_desc:0 "Due to the London Naval Treaty restrictions these will be laid down with only 14inch guns in an attempt to save weight, however the design is fully capable of utilizing triple 15inch or 16inch guns in the absence of treaty limitations."
  eng_battleship_hull_5:0 "Lion Class"
  eng_battleship_hull_5_desc:0 "With the constraints of the naval treaties thrown out of the window with the onset of war, the Lion class serves as an improvement on the King George V class, being armed with the 16 inch guns that the KGVs were designed to mount in the first place. The Lion class also makes improvements all-round, most notably speed and armour."
  eng_battleship_hull_6:0 "Vanguard Class"
  eng_battleship_hull_6_desc:0 "Initially beginning as a stopgap using excess 15 inch guns in storage to get battleships in the sea while the Lions were being built, HMS Vanguard's design was continually altered to reflect the lessons of the war.

  eng_carrier_hull_3_desc:0 "The term 'Supercarrier' was first used by the New York Times in 1938 in reference to HMS Ark Royal. It was not a statement made lightly; with a large complement of planes, a heavy anti-aircraft battery, and the speed to be where she was needed, Ark Royal's integrated flight deck and hangars represent a massive leap forward in carrier design."
  eng_carrier_hull_4:0 "Illustrious Class"
  eng_carrier_hull_4_desc:0 "The concept of the Illustrious class differs from that of US thinking; they would rely on their own anti-air defence and armoured decks to protect themselves from enemy planes, allowing its own to focus on their missions. While this means they cannot carry as many planes as their US counterparts, they are more resilient should the enemy catch them off-guard."
  eng_carrier_hull_5:0 "Implacable Class"
  eng_carrier_hull_5_desc:0 "Retaining the Illustious' thinking of having a strong AA armament and an armoured flight deck, the Implacable class made improvements by adopting a US-style permanent deck-park scheme, which allowed her to carrier far more planes than her predecessors."
  eng_carrier_hull_6:0 "Audacious Class"
  eng_carrier_hull_6_desc:0 "Incorporating taller hangars to allow for more modern planes, the Audacious class suffers from a low plane capacity compared to some of its contemporaries."
