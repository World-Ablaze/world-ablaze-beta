Prime minister [HUN_prime_minister_name] has voiced his personal opinions just before the voting started, in hopes of persuading some of the votees to choose his preferred candidate, namely Albrecht Franz von Habsburg-Teschen, who in the early 1930s claimed the Hungarian throne, but backed down in favor of Otto Habsburg. \nShocked by [HUN_prime_minister_short]'s suggestion, [ROOT.GetLeader] swiftly demanded the voting take place at the moment and dismissed the council as soon as the final result was declared..."

These include Zoltán Böszörmény's scythe cross movement, the MNSZFMP, founded in 1933 by Zoltán Meskó, and various little parties that all call themselves the 'true' MNSZP, with leaders such as Count Fidél Pálffy, Count Sándor Festetics, and others. In 1934, the three leaders Meskó, Pálffy and Festetics made the first step in uniting the parties by signing an alliance. This, however, did not last very long and Festetics went to create a new fascist party with István Balogh, a catholic priest. \n\nThe only one remaining capable of fusing the parties into one is Ferenc Szálasi. His charisma and talent for speech often reminds his listeners of Adolf Hitler, which has secured him a lot of followers all around the parties. First, Balogh's group will be absorbed, as he already has a tight connection to him. Then, he will slowly bring the other parties one by one under his umbrella, while still guaranteeing each individual party's say and identity within the new party, which will be called the one and only "Magyar Nemzeti Szocialista Párt", or "Hungarian National Socialist Party"."

While most of them profess their loyalty to [Root.GetLeader] and the Soviet Union, it is clear that they could easily be turned into spies by foreign agencies.

The best strategy is to make your wars quick and demobilize after a war.\n\nIt is natural to have Economic fatigue when militarizing your economy and it should not be something you should try and keep at 0% The following are the main ways of decreasing economic fatigue:\n\nFocuses\nWar bonds (available when at war) \nDecisions (most are available only when at war)\nLowering your laws (only as a last resort if close to 100% fatigue)\n\nStaying on partial mob will cause your fatigue to go from 0% to 100% in 24 years, War economy takes approximately 10 years, and total mobilization takes approximately 6 years. Be aware that focuses, closed economy, and higher conscription laws can also increase fatigue, try and avoid 100% as your nation will collapse."

It was given the title Handschar after a local fighting knife or sword carried by Ottoman policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the Ottoman Empire. It was the first non-Germanic Waffen-SS division, and its formation marked the expansion of the Waffen-SS into a multi-ethnic military force. Composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers and mostly German and Yugoslav Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it took an oath of allegiance to both Adolf Hitler and the Croatian leader Ante Pavelić. The division fought briefly in the Syrmia region north of the Sava river prior to crossing into northeastern Bosnia. After crossing the Sava, it established a designated 'security zone' in northeastern Bosnia between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Sprea rivers. It also fought outside the security zone on several occasions, and earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians. In late 1944, parts of the division were transferred briefly to the Zagreb area, after which the non-German members began to desert in large numbers. Over the winter of 1944-45, it was sent to the Baranja region where it fought against the Red Army and Bulgarians throughout southern Hungary, falling back via a series of defensive lines until they were inside the Reich frontier. Most of the remaining Bosnian Muslims left at this point and attempted to return to Bosnia. The rest retreated further west, hoping to surrender to the Western Allies.

Operating out of a mountain complex centered on Monte Sole, just southeast of the town of Marzabotto, and sitting astride communications to Bologna, the Red Star was seen as a significant threat to the German rear, both in terms of cutting communications and obstructing a possible route of retreat.

Named Karstjäger ("Karst Hunter"), it was one of the 38 divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer Karstwehr Battalion, its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting partisans in the Karst Plateau on the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy, and Austria; the mountainous terrain required specialised mountain troops and equipment. Founded in 1942 as a company, the unit consisted mainly of Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans/Austrians) from Yugoslavia and the South Tyrol province of Italy. Although focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw action in the wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945. A joint Italian-German study implicated the division in 23 separate war crimes involving the killing of a total of 277 people between the Italian surrender and the end of the war."
