    afo_event.1.d:0 "World Ablaze is a total overhaul mod that changes almost all the game mechanics, expands them and adds a tougher AI. Most of the changes are easy to figure out like the focus tree's. But if you are unfamiliar with the mod you can find a few options below that will help clarify some of the more of the hidden changes to the game. \n\nIf you are interested in getting involved with World Ablaze, there is a link to our discord where I recommend anyone to post their feedback and suggestions or talk with other players of WA. It also has a beta version where we test upcoming features to the mod. Both have links that can be found on the steam mod description\n\nHave fun!"

    afo_event.2.d:0 "Government laws can now give a weekly penalty to war support, to combat this there are more decisions and ministries you can invest in. They also gradually provide economy fatigue which reduces construction and repair speed. The best strategy is to make your war's quick and go to civilian economy after a war.\n\n Economy Fatigue is a new system to World Ablaze, it represents inflation and large government spending that goes beyond their income.\n\n It is national to have Economic fatigue when militarizing your economy and he goal is to no reach 100%, The following are the main ways of decreasing economic fatigue:\n\nFocuses\nWar bonds (available when a war) \nDecisions (most are available only when at war)\nLowering your laws (only as a last resort if close to 100% fatigue\n\n Staying on partial mob will cause your fatigue to from 0% to 100% in 24 years, War economy is 12 and total mobilization is 6. Be aware that focuses can also increase fatigue"

Organization takes longer to regain and is dependant on infrastructure. New units have been added and the descriptions for the unique ones can be found below.\n\nArmoured Cars, they are split between combat and scout. Combat cars generally have a equal armament to light tanks but are cheaper and less durable. Scout cars provide org and can be used as recon. They are also wheeled which gives them different terrain modfiers.\n\nAssault Tanks, they have much more armor and soft attack than SPG's but have less breakthrough and defence. They also serve on the front lines making them alot more vulnerable than SPG's. As a result of there extra armor they cost more too. \n\nHeavy Units, Currently field guns and infantry have heavy variants.

    afo_event.6.d:0 "The Ministries Section has been added to the Political Tab.\n\nThe new additions include:\nMinistry of Culture which is focused around women’s place in society. It starts off with more home orientated roles that give you higher stability, but you can change it, at a significant cost or through focuses, to provide more bonuses to your industry and army. For example, higher recruitable population and/or factory output.\n\nMinistry of Defence is focused on war bonds. You use these to reduce your economic fatigue. However, these can only be accessed during war situations and come at the cost of consumer goods for 2 years.\n\nMinistry of Propaganda is focused on providing war support. Since high tier economy laws take weekly war support, this is used to counter that. Each level provides 0.1% weekly war support and takes 0.05 political power per day.\n\nMinistry of Labour is focused on providing miscellaneous buffs such as stability for some consumer goods or a small recruitable population boost for some PP.\n\nMinistry of Business is essentially your economic ideology and it is heavily tied to your political ideology. Fascists can’t fully privatise for example and democracies can’t follow the ideas of national socialism. Each economic ideology provide different buffs and debuffs that range from stability increases/decreases, consumer goods increases/decreases, construction speed, research time, ideology drift defence and so on."
