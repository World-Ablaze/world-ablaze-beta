    usa_modern_spg_equipment_2_desc:0 "Very similar in offensive stats to the M40, the M53 is much better equipped to deal with counterbattery. A better engine allows the tank to be much more mobile to avoid attempts, and a better armoured, closed case mate protects the crew in such an eventuality occurring."

This grants it very good breakthrough and piercing values that assault guns are notoriously lacking in. At the same time, its armour and soft attack values are still very good. All of these stats come at a cost, as the tank is expensive to produce."
