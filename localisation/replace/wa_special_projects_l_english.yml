  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward_option: "We must secure enough uranium"
  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward_option_controlled_tt: "Since we and our subjects directly control enough states with §YUranium§! deposits (3), the project will progress §Gfaster than anticipated§!."

  sp_nuclear_isotope_separation_choice_reward_desc: "Enriched uranium is required for sustained nuclear reactions. Diffusion, either thermal or gaseous, could be promising in the longrun while Electromagnetic shows results now and Centrifugal could be the cheapest. If time is of the essence, we could push for all simultaneously at a cost..."

  sp_nuclear_design_choice_reward: "Nuclear Reaction Moderator"
  sp_nuclear_design_choice_reward_desc: "In order to ensure a nuclear chain reaction proceeds at a manageable rate, a moderator is needed to absorb excess neutrons. Heavy Water can be used, if we have appropriate production. Purified Graphite, although more expensive, could work as well."

  sp_nuclear_reactor_choice_reward: "Nuclear Fuel"
  sp_nuclear_reactor_choice_reward_desc: "Now that we know large-scale production of plutonium is possible as a by-product of uranium-fueled nuclear reactors, we could choose to focus on it as a source of fuel over traditional uranium. It would be easier to produce than enriched uranium, although its usefulness elsewhere is not yet known."

  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward: "Security Shortfall"
  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward_desc: "There's been a minor security issue. Our phone bugs caught one of [Character.GetName]'s lab assistants mentioning the general location of the nuclear research facility in a call to his lover. This will require a small effort to contain."
  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward_option: "Silence Means Security"

  sp_nuclear_major_security_generic_reward: "Major Security Breach"
  sp_nuclear_major_security_generic_reward_desc: "There's been a major security breach. One of the mid-level scientists under [Character.GetName] has been caught hoarding and transporting data files related to project chemical experiment results offsite. When questioned, he admitted that he had plans to use this to push his own commercially successful company in the field."
  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward_option_fire: "Fire him and revoke his clearance immediately"
  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward_option_keep: "His expertise is too valuable to lose"

  sp_nuclear_war_priorities_generic_reward_desc: "Despite results promised by [Character.GetName], the [SpecialProject.GetName] project has come under increased scrutiny and interference from military leaders. They have been playing politics to have resources and funding shifted away from this project and toward their own departments, causing delays and potentially forcing changes in project leadership. We need to decide what to do about these political challenges."
  sp_nuclear_war_priorities_generic_reward_option_agree: "Everything is needed for the war effort"
  sp_nuclear_war_priorities_generic_reward_option_ignore: "This project will be our military's top priority"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_test_prototype_reward: "Nuclear Test"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_test_prototype_reward_desc: "A prototype bomb has been produced by [Character.GetName]'s team.

  sp_nuclear_bomb_test_prototype_reward_keep_bomb: "We need this weapon now"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_test_prototype_reward_keep_bomb_tt: "We will have an extra atomic bomb at our dispoal once the project is completed, but there's a small risk of a dud upon first use."

  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward: "Detonator Design"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_desc: "There are two designs for detonating an atomic weapon being pursued by our scientists, and a debate has emerged over which to proceed with. The gun-type design is far simpler but also less efficient in its use of nuclear material. The implosion design is much more challenging but theoretically more efficient in its use of nuclear material."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_gun_type: "The gun-type is a safer bet"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_implosion: "Implosion must be hashed out"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_both: "Both should be developed"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_initiator_choice_reward: "Initiator Design"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_initiator_choice_reward_desc: "In order to achieve critical mass and trigger a chain reaction, an initiator is needed to ensure a rapid supply of neutrons for a strong fission reaction. A combination of polonium and beryllium has been identified as the ideal initiator. However, polonium is extremely rare and hard to safely collect in quantities required for this purpose."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_initiator_choice_reward_pile: "Existing reactors can produce it"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_initiator_choice_reward_pile_tt: "This option would yield more progress if we had previously invested into more §YNuclear Reactors§!"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_fuze_choice_reward: "Fuze Design"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_fuze_choice_reward_desc: "Some sort of environmental trigger is required to fire the detonator to start the fission chain reaction and, unlike normal bombs, this one needs to detonate above the ground. A barometer is simple in telling altitude but unreliable while falling; a clock is mechanically complex; and a radar activated fuze is unproven and could be interfered with the bomber dropping it."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_fuze_choice_reward_barometer: "A barometer is cheap and sufficient for the task"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_clock: "We need to put effort into miniaturizing a clock"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_radar: "We must engineer a solution to radar interference"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_all: "A combination is expensive but offers redundancy"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_dud_tt: "Without fuze redundancy, there's a small chance of a dud upon first use."

  sp_nuclear_bomb_critical_mass_generic_reward: "Critical Mass Experiment Disaster"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_critical_mass_generic_reward_desc: "Lax lab safety measures allowed by [Character.GetName] contributed to an accident that occurred during experiments to determine ideal bomb critical mass. This has lead to radiation exposure and casualties among key personnel."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_critical_mass_generic_reward_option: "Safety must be made a top priority"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_accident_generic_reward: "Accidental Fire"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_accident_generic_reward_desc: "A fire broke out in one of the warehouses at the [SpecialProject.GetName] facility. Initial investigation points towards it being an accident, but rumors say otherwise. Whispers of a traitor swirl."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_accident_generic_reward_option: "Double the facility guard patrols"

  nuclear_raid_dud_tt: "§RThe atomic bomb was successfully dropped but failed to function correctly and landed unexploded as a dud.§!"
