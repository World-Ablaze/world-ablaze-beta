  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward: "Uranium Supply"
  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward_desc: "A large and steady supply of Uranium is the single most important aspect of this project. Securing enough of it to allow for wide-ranging research is imperative for success."
  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward_option: "We must secure enough uranium"
  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward_option_controlled_tt: "Since we and our subjects directly control enough states with §YUranium§! deposits, the project will progress §Gfaster than anticipated§!."
  sp_nuclear_supply_choice_reward_option_allied_tt: "Although we and our subjects' lack direct control over enough §YUranium§! deposits, we and our Allies control enough such that the project will progress §Gat full speed§!. \nBringing more Uranium deposits under our and our subjects' direct control would allow the project to progress even faster than anticipated and may lead to an additional §YNuclear Reactors§!."

  sp_nuclear_isotope_separation_choice_reward: "Isotope Separation Facilities"
  sp_nuclear_isotope_separation_choice_reward_desc: "Enriched uranium is required for sustained nuclear reactions. Diffusion, either thermal or gaseous, could be promising in the longrun while Electromagnetic shows results now and Centrifugal could be the cheapest. If time is of the essence, we could push for all simultaneously at a cost..."

  sp_nuclear_design_choice_reward: "Nuclear Reaction Moderator"
  sp_nuclear_design_choice_reward_desc: "In order to ensure the nuclear chain reaction proceeds at a manageable rate, a moderator is needed to absorb excess neutrons. Heavy Water can be used, if we have appropriate production. Purified Graphite, although more expensive, would work as well."

  sp_nuclear_design_choice_reward_heavy_water: "Heavy water will be cheaper"

  sp_nuclear_reactor_choice_reward_desc: "Now that we know large-scale production of plutonium is possible as a by-product of uranium nuclear reactors, we could choose to focus on it as a source of fuel over traditional uranium. It would be easier to produce than enriched uranium, although its usefulness elsewhere is not yet known."
