  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward: "Security Shortfall"
  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward_desc: "There's been a minor security issue. Our phone bugs caught one of [Character.GetName]'s lab assistants mentioning the general location of the nuclear research facility in a call to his lover. This will require a small effort to contain."
  sp_nuclear_minor_security_generic_reward_option: "Silence Means Security"

  sp_nuclear_reactor_radioactive_leak_stabilized_reward: "Radioactivity Leak"
  sp_nuclear_reactor_radioactive_leak_stabilized_reward_desc: "Unfortunately there was a serious incident during the work with the reactor. Thanks to the rapid response by [Character.GetName]'s' staff, the damage has been contained and the team was able to gather valuable data from the incident."

  sp_nuclear_major_security_generic_reward: "Major Security Breach"
  sp_nuclear_major_security_generic_reward_desc: "There's been a major security breach. One of the mid-level scientists under [Character.GetName] has been caught hoarding and transporting data files related to project chemical experiment results offsite. When questioned, he admitted that he had plans to use this to push his own commercially successful company in the field."

  sp_nuclear_war_priorities_generic_reward_desc: "Despite results promised by [Character.GetName], the [SpecialProject.GetName] project has come under increased scrutiny and interference from military leaders. They have been playing politics to have resources and funding shifted away from this project and toward their own departments, causing delays and potentially forcing changes in project leadership. We need to decide what to do about these political challenges."
  sp_nuclear_war_priorities_generic_reward_option_agree: "Everything is needed for the war effort"
  sp_nuclear_war_priorities_generic_reward_option_ignore: "This project will be our military's top priority"

  sp_nuclear_brain_drain_generic_reward: "Lack of National Expertise"
  sp_nuclear_brain_drain_generic_reward_desc: "Although [Character.GetName] is a top expert in his field, our national policies have caused those politically labeled as 'undesirables' to leave, even if they have expertise that could have been useful on this project. This brain drain has had a major effect on the national academia and leaves the rest of [Character.GetName]'s' team lacking in capability."

  ########################## Nuclear Bomb ##########################

  sp_nuclear_bomb_test_prototype_reward_keep_bomb_tt: "We will have an extra atomic bomb at our dispoal once the project is completed, but there's a small risk of a dud upon first use."

  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward: "Detonator Design"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_desc: "There are two designs for detonating an atomic weapon being pursued by our scientists, and a debate has emerged over which to proceed with. The gun-type design is far simpler especially for uranium but also less efficient in its use of nuclear material. The implosion design is much more challenging but theoretically more efficient in its use of nuclear material especially when it comes to plutonium."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_gun_type: "The gun-type is a safer bet"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_fuze_choice_reward: "Fuze Design"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_fuze_choice_reward_desc: "Some sort of environmental trigger is required to fire the detonator to start the fission chain reaction and, unlike normal bombs, this one needs to detonate above the ground. A barometer is simple in telling altitude but unreliable while falling; a clock is mechanically complex; and a radar activated fuze is unproven and could be interfered with the bomber dropping it."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_fuze_choice_reward_barometer: "A barometer is cheap and sufficient for the task"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_clock: "We need to put effort into miniaturizing a clock"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_radar: "We must engineer a solution to radar interference"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_all: "A combination is expensive but offers redundancy"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_dud_tt: "Without fuze redundancy, there's a small chance of a dud upon first use."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_radar_no_tt: "Since we have not researched the §YAdvanced Centimetric Radar§! technology, this may be a costly mistake if we do not have it soon."

  sp_nuclear_bomb_lacking_radar_reward: "Insufficient Radar Technology"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_lacking_radar_reward_desc: "The radar fuze design was chosen to be pursued for the bomb, but our radar technology has not matured enough to the point where it can be both miniaturised it to fit in the bomb while maintaining the required accuracy and interference-tolerance needed to accurately trigger the fuze. We have lost valuable time, progress, and resources that we cannot recoup from going down a dead-end path. There is now not enough time to research this technology further, so another design must be chosen.\n\n"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_trigger_choice_reward_radar_loss_tt: "We have lost valuable time, progress, and resources that we cannot recoup from going down a dead-end path. We must bite the bullet and choose a viable path forward."

  sp_nuclear_bomb_wrong_trigger_reward: "Detonator Mismatch"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_wrong_trigger_reward_option_uranium_tt: "The implosion detonator design was chosen to be pursued for the bomb, but testing has discovered that this would only successfully detonate a plutonium bomb. Since uranium was chosen as the primary weapon material, the alternative detonator design, the gun-type detonator, needs to be developed. We have lost valuable time, progress, and resources that we cannot recoup from going down a dead-end path. \n\n"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_wrong_trigger_reward_option_plutonium_tt: "The gun-type detonator design was chosen to be pursued for the bomb, but testing has discovered that this would only successfully detonate an uranium bomb. Since plutonium was chosen as the primary weapon material, the alternative detonator design, the implosion detonator, needs to be developed.We have lost valuable time, progress, and resources that we cannot recoup from going down a dead-end path. \n\n"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_critical_mass_generic_reward: "Critical Mass Experiment Disaster"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_critical_mass_generic_reward_desc: "Lax lab safety measures allowed by [Character.GetName] contributed to an accident that occurred during experiments to determine ideal bomb critical mass. This has lead to radiation exposure and casualties among key personnel."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_critical_mass_generic_reward_option: "Safety must be made a top priority"

  sp_nuclear_bomb_accident_generic_reward: "Accidental Fire"
  sp_nuclear_bomb_accident_generic_reward_desc: "A fire broke out in one of the warehouses at the [SpecialProject.GetName] facility. Initial investigation points towards it being an accident, but rumors say otherwise. Whispers of a traitor swirl."
  sp_nuclear_bomb_accident_generic_reward_option: "Double the facility guard patrols"

  nuclear_raid_dud_tt: "§RThe atomic bomb was successfully dropped but failed to function correctly and landed unexploded as a dud.§!"
