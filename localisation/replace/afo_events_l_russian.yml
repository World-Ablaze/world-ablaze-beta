Оно начинает с более ориентированных на дом ролей, которые дают вам более высокий прирост населения, но вы можете изменить их с помощью значительных затрат или фокусов, чтобы обеспечить больше бонусов для вашей промышленности и армии. Например, более высокий уровень рекрутируемого населения и/или производства фабрик.\n\nМинистерство обороны сосредоточено на военных облигациях. Вы используете их для снижения экономической усталости. Однако они могут быть доступны только во время военных действий и выдаются по цене потребительских товаров на 2 года.\n\nМинистерство пропаганды ориентировано на оказание поддержки в войне. Поскольку законы экономики высокого уровня требуют еженедельной поддержки войны, оно используется для борьбы с этим. Каждый уровень обеспечивает 0,1% еженедельной поддержки войны и отнимает 0,05 политической силы в день.\n\nМинистерство труда сосредоточено на предоставлении различных баффов, таких как стабильность для некоторых потребительских товаров или небольшой прирост рекрутируемого населения.\n\nМинистерство экономики - это, по сути, ваша экономическая идеология, и она сильно привязана к вашей политической идеологии. Например, фашисты не могут полностью приватизировать, а демократы не могут следовать идеям национал-социализма. Каждая экономическая идеология дает различные баффы и дебаффы, которые варьируются от увеличения/уменьшения стабильности, увеличения/уменьшения потребительских товаров, скорости строительства, времени исследования, защиты от дрейфа идеологии и так далее."

It was given the title Handschar after a local fighting knife or sword carried by Ottoman policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the Ottoman Empire. It was the first non-Germanic Waffen-SS division, and its formation marked the expansion of the Waffen-SS into a multi-ethnic military force. Composed of Bosnian Muslims (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic Croat soldiers and mostly German and Yugoslav Volksdeutsche (ethnic German) officers and non-commissioned officers, it took an oath of allegiance to both Adolf Hitler and the Croatian leader Ante Pavelić. The division fought briefly in the Syrmia region north of the Sava river prior to crossing into northeastern Bosnia. After crossing the Sava, it established a designated 'security zone' in northeastern Bosnia between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Sprea rivers. It also fought outside the security zone on several occasions, and earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians. In late 1944, parts of the division were transferred briefly to the Zagreb area, after which the non-German members began to desert in large numbers. Over the winter of 1944-45, it was sent to the Baranja region where it fought against the Red Army and Bulgarians throughout southern Hungary, falling back via a series of defensive lines until they were inside the Reich frontier. Most of the remaining Bosnian Muslims left at this point and attempted to return to Bosnia. The rest retreated further west, hoping to surrender to the Western Allies. Most of the remaining members became prisoners of the British Army."

In late summer 1944, a part of this division, SS-Panzer-Aufklärungsabteilung 16 (Reconnaissance Battalion 16), commanded by Major Walter Reder, was withdrawn from engagement with the American 5th Army then advancing on the Gothic Line to deal with an Italian Communist partisan unit, the Red Star Brigade (Brigata Stella Rossa). Operating out of a mountain complex centered on Monte Sole, just southeast of the town of Marzabotto, and sitting astride communications to Bologna, the Red Star was seen as a significant threat to the German rear, both in terms of cutting communications and obstructing a possible route of retreat. Major Reder completed his assignment and destroyed this guerrilla force. A Kampfgruppe of the 16th Training and Replacement Battalion was based in Arnhem and took part in Operation Market Garden.

Named Karstjäger ("Karst Hunter"), it was one of the 38 divisions fielded by the Waffen-SS. Formed on 18 July 1944 from the SS Volunteer Karstwehr Battalion, its nominal strength was never more than theoretical and the division was soon reduced to the Waffen Mountain (Karstjäger) Brigade of the SS. Throughout its existence as a battalion, division and brigade, it was primarily involved in fighting partisans in the Karst Plateau on the frontiers of Yugoslavia, Italy, and Austria; the mountainous terrain required specialised mountain troops and equipment. Founded in 1942 as a company, the unit consisted mainly of Volksdeutsche (ethnic Germans/Austrians) from Yugoslavia and the South Tyrol province of Italy. Although focused on anti-partisan operations, it also saw action in the wake of the Italian surrender when it moved to disarm Italian troops in Tarvisio and protect ethnic German communities in Italy. In addition, at the end of the war it successfully fought to keep passes into Austria open, allowing German units to escape the Balkans and surrender to British forces. The remnants of the unit became some of the last Germans to lay down their arms when they surrendered to the British 6th Armoured Division on 9 May 1945. A joint Italian-German study implicated the division in 23 separate war crimes involving the killing of a total of 277 people between the Italian surrender and the end of the war."
