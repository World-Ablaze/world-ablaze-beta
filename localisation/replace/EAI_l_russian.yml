Also, some settings may be more immersive to you than others.\n\nWhat are§! §Ydynamic§! §Lsettings? It means that the mod gives these bonuses to countries depending on how the game progresses instead of just giving a permanent bonus to all AI countries. Dynamic settings are enabled for AI countries that are at war with you (a player) and are in close proximity to you or your allies.§! §YCountry-specific§! §Lsettings on the other hand are always active and do not care whether the AI is fighting another AI or a player.\n\nWhat is the§! §YBonus§! §Lsetting and how is it different from the vanilla slider bonuses? This setting is - for the most part - meant to boost the AI's industry in order to compensate for the enormous equipment losses that the AI takes during wars. The most important part of this bonus is a cost reduction to any land and air equipment that the AI is short on which is far higher than any slider bonus. That means the AI only has an easier time producing equipment that it really needs but doesn't build unrealistic stockpiles of things it doesn't need.\n\nWhat is§! §YDesperate Defense§!§L?

Note that equipment cost reduction does not stack when using both, only the highest of the two modifiers is used.\n\nWhat are§! §YReinforcements§!§L?
