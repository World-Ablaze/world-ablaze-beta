By training our operatives to infiltrate enemy resistance movements, we may begin being able to make effective arrests and end their disruptive activities. Surely then, foreign partisans will lose any hope of returning to their old regime.§!"

 upgrade_plastic_explosives:0 "Plastic explosives"
 upgrade_plastic_explosives_desc:0 "§LThe putty-like texture of plastic explosives makes them ideal for sabotaging enemy production so it is only natural that we arm foreign partisans with the substance. The bombs can easily be placed out-of-sight and in vulnerable areas of enemy factories, and the malleable nature of the substance would make it an ideal weapon in a spectacular political assassination...§!"

 upgrade_commando_training:0 "Commando training"
 upgrade_commando_training_desc:1 "§LWhile our department usually handles the subtler aspects of war, often a small team of heavily armed soldiers are what's needed to complete our operations. By training all of our operatives the ways of Commando warfare, they will become more effective at sabotage operations, less likely to be detected by enemy counter-intelligence and more capable at capturing enemy cryptologic equipment.§!"
 upgrade_interrogation_techniques:0 "Interrogation techniques"
 upgrade_interrogation_techniques_desc:0 "§LOften it can be more effective to break an enemy agent's mind rather than their body. The use of physical force is unreliable and often results in false information; a truly skilled interrogator is capable of breaking the enemy's will without violence. But, if it comes to that, we have ways of making them talk...§!"

 upgrade_psycho_warfare_desc:0 "§LPropaganda has been an effective tool in securing our ideological interests within our own state, but no tool has been quite as effective as spreading fear of the enemy regimes and what they may bring to the country. By allying our agents with anti-ideological movements within foreign nations, we shall become far more effective in spreading our ideology worldwide...§!"
 upgrade_form_department:0 "Form Department"
 upgrade_form_department_desc:0 "§LCryptology is the method of creating codes and cyphers to maintain secret communications.

 upgrade_decryption_boost:1 "Radio Interception Group"
 upgrade_decryption_boost_desc:0 "§LRadio waves have made it possible to communicate remotely across long distances, and signals are often encrypted by constantly changing the frequency of the broadcast at an irregular rate. If we are to intercept enemy communications, we must establish an interception group dedicated to cracking enemy radio encryption.§!"
 upgrade_decryption_boost_2:1 "Machine-Assisted Decryption"
 upgrade_decryption_boost_2_desc:0 "§LMachines have proven useful in encrypting data already, with machine-assisted encrypted signals proving the most difficult to decipher.

 upgrade_crypto_strength:1 "Government Cypher School"
 upgrade_crypto_strength_desc:0 "§LCodes and cyphers have thus far proven to be the most effective way of establishing and protecting our spy networks overseas. The Government Communication Headquarters shall dedicate itself to the creation of new and elaborate encryption methods that our enemies shall be helpless to decipher.§!"
 upgrade_crypto_strength_2:0 "Machine-Assisted Encryption"
 upgrade_crypto_strength_2_desc:0 "§LIt's becoming apparent that our standard method of creating cyphers is insufficient to protect our communications from enemy eyes. Our finest minds have theorised a machine which can scramble the letters of the alphabet to generate new cyphers on as regular a basis as we desire. Deploying such technology would make our encryption methods a total enigma to our enemies.§!"
