# WA AI Military System

Authoritative spec for the layer model, domain split, per-type overlap policy, and naming convention used by every `ai_strategy` block in `common/ai_strategy/WA_AI_MILITARY_*.txt`.

Read this document **before** adding or changing any military `ai_strategy` block. The companion file `WA_AI_MILITARY_TYPES_REFERENCE.md` lists every `type =` currently in use, where it lives today, and its target layer.

This is the Phase 1 contract. It describes the target shape of the system. Existing files do not yet conform on every point; migration is staged across Phases 2-6 (see end of this document). Until each phase lands, the rules below apply to **new and modified** blocks.

---

## 1. Purpose

The WA AI military system steers AI strategic-level military behaviour: front allocation and unit requests, front control modes, invasion budgets and targets, garrison weighting, theatre distribution, naval region avoidance, strike-force basing, force concentration, and country-to-country diplomatic intent flags (`conquer`, `protect`, `ignore`, `contain`, etc.). It does **not** cover production, templates, equipment design, lend-lease, or research; those are owned by other WA_AI subsystems documented in `AGENTS.md`.

All system content lives in `common/ai_strategy/WA_AI_MILITARY_*.txt` and is gated by triggers in `common/scripted_triggers/WA_AI_MILITARY_triggers.txt` and `common/scripted_triggers/WA_AI_CONFIG.txt`.

---

## 2. Layer model (4 layers)

| Layer | Files | Gating | Country tags allowed? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Default** | `WA_AI_MILITARY_DEFAULT_*.txt` | Archetype triggers only (`WA_AI_MILITARY_is_major_continental`, `WA_AI_MILITARY_is_major_naval`, `WA_AI_MILITARY_is_minor_country`, etc.) | No |
| **Region** | `WA_AI_MILITARY_REGION_<NAME>.txt` | Geography triggers (e.g. `WA_AI_CONFIG_MILITARY_is_south_america`) | No |
| **Faction** | `WA_AI_MILITARY_FACTION_<NAME>[_<DOMAIN>].txt` | Faction-membership triggers (`WA_AI_MILITARY_is_allies_member`, `_is_axis_member`, `_is_comintern_member`, `_is_co_prosperity_member`, `_is_china_front_member`, `_is_commonwealth_member`) plus optional `WA_AI_CONFIG_MILITARY_*` archetype refinement | No |
| **Country** | `WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_<TAG>[_<DOMAIN>].txt` | Country gating; `tag = <TAG>` and `original_tag = <TAG>` are allowed and expected | Yes |

### Layer responsibilities

- **Default** carries generic archetype-driven behaviour for any country matching an archetype trigger. Examples: minimum garrison floor for minors, default armor scoring for continental majors, default unit-request scaling for naval majors. Default rules must work for any country that hits the archetype trigger without further customisation.
- **Region** carries geography-driven shared rules that span multiple countries but are not faction-bound. Example: South American countries staying at home and not invading distant theatres regardless of faction membership.
- **Faction** carries coalition behaviour: where the bloc collectively defends, where it invades, who it ignores, intra-faction `force_defend_ally_borders` patterns, etc. Faction blocks may further refine by archetype (`WA_AI_CONFIG_MILITARY_is_axis_minor` inside an Axis faction file is fine), but they may not target individual countries by tag.
- **Country** carries country-specific behaviour. This is the only layer permitted to use `tag = <TAG>` and `original_tag = <TAG>`. If a rule depends on a single country's geography, doctrine, or historical role, it belongs here.

### When a behaviour spans layers

If the same intent can be expressed at multiple layers, prefer the **highest-shared layer** (Default > Region > Faction > Country). Push down to a lower layer only when the higher layer's archetype/region/faction trigger does not capture the actual scope of the rule. Do not duplicate the same block at multiple layers; that is exactly what Phase 4 will de-duplicate, and what the Phase 5 mutual-exclusion triggers exist to manage for the few Exclusive types.

---

## 3. Domain split convention

Every country and every faction with content in more than one domain is split into one file per domain. This is a uniform structure, applied even for small files, so that adding a new strategy block always has a predictable destination.

| Domain | File suffix | Strategy types it owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Front | `_FRONT` | `front_unit_request`, `front_control`, `front_armor_score`, `force_concentration_front_factor`, `force_concentration_target_weight`, `force_ratio`, `infantry`, `garrison` (small/normal cases) |
| Invasion | `_INVASION` | `invasion_unit_request`, `invade`, `naval_invasion_focus` |
| Naval | `_NAVAL` | `naval_avoid_region`, `strike_force_home_base`, `strategic_air_importance` (when the rule is sea-facing) |
| Diplomacy | `_DIPLOMACY` | `conquer`, `antagonize`, `protect`, `contain`, `ignore`, `ignore_claim`, `declare_war`, `diplo_action_desire`, `diplo_action_acceptance`, `dont_defend_ally_borders`, `force_defend_ally_borders` |
| Theatre | `_THEATRE` | `theatre_distribution_demand_increase`, `area_priority`, `put_unit_buffers`, `spare_unit_factor` |
| Garrison | `_GARRISON` | Only when garrison rules for one country are large enough to warrant their own file; otherwise garrison stays inside `_FRONT` |

A given country only gets a file for the domains in which it actually has content. A Default or Faction file may be unsplit if it only carries one domain (e.g. `WA_AI_MILITARY_DEFAULT_INVASION.txt` is fine without a `_FRONT` sibling).

Names follow the pattern `WA_AI_MILITARY_<LAYER>_<DOMAIN>[_<TAG>].txt`. Examples:

- `WA_AI_MILITARY_DEFAULT_FRONT_archetypes.txt`
- `WA_AI_MILITARY_REGION_SOUTH_AMERICA.txt`
- `WA_AI_MILITARY_FACTION_ALLIES_INVASION.txt`
- `WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_USA_NAVAL.txt`

## 4. Per-type overlap policy

This is the master legend. For each `ai_strategy` `type` currently in use, it states how the engine combines values, whether the WA system treats the type as **Additive** (multiple layers may contribute) or **Exclusive** (only one layer should set it), and the precedence rule when Exclusive.

| Type | Engine combination | Policy | Precedence (if Exclusive) | Typical range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `front_unit_request` | Sums per area | Additive | n/a | -1500 to +200 |
| `area_priority` | Sums per area | Additive | n/a | -200 to +200 |
| `theatre_distribution_demand_increase` | Sums per area | Additive | n/a | 0 to +500 |
| `force_concentration_front_factor` | Sums | Additive | n/a | 0.0 to 2.0 |
| `force_concentration_target_weight` | Sums per target | Additive | n/a | 0 to 100 |
| `front_armor_score` | Sums | Additive | n/a | 0 to +50 |
| `strategic_air_importance` | Sums per area | Additive | n/a | 0 to +500 |
| `garrison` | Max wins; large negatives force-off | Additive (with negative-override convention) | n/a | -5000 (force off) or 0 to 200 |
| `infantry` | Sums | Additive | n/a | 0 to 100 |
| `spare_unit_factor` | Sums | Additive | n/a | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `front_control` | Per area, last-set wins per mode | **Exclusive per area** | Country > Faction > Default | mode enum |
| `protect` | Boolean per target | **Exclusive per target** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `ignore` | Boolean per target | **Exclusive per target** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `ignore_claim` | Boolean per target | **Exclusive per target** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `contain` | Boolean per target | **Exclusive per target** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `naval_invasion_focus` | Boolean | **Exclusive** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `strike_force_home_base` | Boolean per region | **Exclusive per region** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `dont_defend_ally_borders` | Boolean per ally | **Exclusive per ally** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `force_defend_ally_borders` | Boolean per ally | **Exclusive per ally** | Country > Faction > Default | bool |
| `invasion_unit_request` | Sums | Additive | n/a | 0 to 50 |
| `invade` | Sums per target | Additive per target | n/a | 0 to 200 |
| `conquer` | Sums per target | Additive per target | n/a | 0 to 200 |
| `antagonize` | Sums per target | Additive per target | n/a | 0 to 200 |
| `naval_avoid_region` | Sums per region | Additive per region | n/a | 0 to +500 |
| `put_unit_buffers` | Sums per state | Additive per state | n/a | 0 to 100 |
| `declare_war` | Sums per target | Country-only | n/a | 0 to 100 |
| `diplo_action_desire` | Sums per target/action | Country-only | n/a | 0 to 100 |
| `diplo_action_acceptance` | Sums per target/action | Country-only | n/a | 0 to 100 |

### Notes on the policy column

- **Additive** means the engine combines values from multiple `ai_strategy` blocks (typically by sum, sometimes by max). Layers may safely contribute to the same key. Tuning differences between layers are by design.
- **Exclusive** means the WA system enforces single-layer ownership for a given key (target, area, ally, region, mode). The engine may still technically allow multiple writers, but stacking writers produces unpredictable behaviour. Phase 5 will introduce mutual-exclusion triggers to enforce this; until then, authors must hold the precedence rule manually.
- `garrison` uses a **negative-override convention**: a single block of `value = -5000` is the documented way to force garrison off in a state, and is treated as authoritative regardless of other writers. This is how `WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_SPR.txt:143-144` disables garrison in a specific configuration.
- `declare_war`, `diplo_action_desire`, and `diplo_action_acceptance` are Country-only by convention: the Default and Faction layers should never push a country to declare war or accept diplomacy; that decision belongs in the country's own file.

## 5. Authoring rules

1. **Every block must declare an `enable = { ... }` clause.** `always = yes` is forbidden except for an explicitly justified static defensive bias. Such blocks must include a comment beginning with `# always-on:` explaining why no dynamic gate is appropriate.
2. **No `tag = X` or `original_tag = X` outside Country layer files.** Faction, Region, and Default layers must use `WA_AI_CONFIG_MILITARY_*` archetype/region triggers or `WA_AI_MILITARY_is_<faction>_member` triggers.
   - **Grace clause:** until Phase 3 is complete, existing tag lists in faction files (e.g. `WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_CHINA_FRONT.txt`) may remain in place. They must not be **extended**, and any modification of an existing block in those files must replace the tag list with an archetype trigger or relocate the block to a Country file.
3. **Each strategy block must include a header comment** with at least: `purpose`, `range`, `policy` (Additive or Exclusive), and `domain`. Example:
   ```
   # purpose: discourage USN from sailing into the Black Sea
   # range:   0 to +500
   # policy:  Additive per region
   # domain:  NAVAL
   WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_USA_NAVAL_avoid_black_sea = { ... }
   ```
4. **Block names must follow** `WA_AI_MILITARY_<LAYER>_<DOMAIN>_<DESCRIPTOR>` for Default/Region/Faction blocks, and `WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_<TAG>_<DOMAIN>_<DESCRIPTOR>` for Country blocks. The descriptor is lowercase snake_case and should describe the *behaviour*, not the tag.
5. **Do not duplicate behaviour across layers.** If a Default rule and a Country rule cover the same intent, the Country rule should either differ meaningfully (Additive types) or replace the Default rule under Phase 5 mutual-exclusion (Exclusive types). For Phase 1, document the duplication in `WA_AI_MILITARY_TYPES_REFERENCE.md` rather than fixing it.
6. **Country-specific blocks living in faction files must be re-homed** to `WA_AI_MILITARY_COUNTRY_<TAG>_<DOMAIN>.txt` during Phase 2-4. Until then, keep them where they are but flag them in the types reference.

---

## 6. Mutual exclusion mechanism (preview, deferred to Phase 5)

For Exclusive-policy types, pairs of scripted triggers will guard layers so that the Country layer takes precedence over Faction, and Faction over Default, on a per-key basis (per target, per area, per ally, per region, per mode):

- `WA_AI_MILITARY_country_owns_<exclusive_key> = yes` - Country layer asserts ownership of this key.
- Faction blocks add `NOT = { WA_AI_MILITARY_country_owns_<exclusive_key> = yes }` to their `enable`.
- Default blocks add both `NOT = { WA_AI_MILITARY_country_owns_<exclusive_key> = yes }` and `NOT = { WA_AI_MILITARY_faction_owns_<exclusive_key> = yes }`.

Additive types are never gated by these triggers. Phase 5 will define the exact set of `<exclusive_key>` slugs and generate the trigger pairs; Phase 1 only commits to the contract.

## 7. Target file layout (post-refactor, for reference)

This is the post-Phase-2/3 target. It is reproduced here so that authors can choose the right destination today even though the rename is not yet done.

```

The current set of source files is the input to this layout; see `WA_AI_MILITARY_TYPES_REFERENCE.md` for the per-file inventory.

## 8. Phase plan

Phase 1 (this document): documentation and contract only. No script edits.

| Phase | Scope | Behaviour change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | File renames and domain splits per the target layout. Move country-specific blocks out of faction files. | None intended (pure relocation). |
| 3 | Replace inline `tag = X` lists in faction/region/default files with `WA_AI_CONFIG_MILITARY_*` archetype triggers. Add new triggers as needed. | None intended for in-scope countries; behaviour for newly-covered countries possible. |
| 4 | De-duplicate content across layers using the policy table. Lift shared behaviour up; push country-specific behaviour down. | Possible, controlled by parity tests. |
| 5 | Introduce mutual-exclusion triggers (`WA_AI_MILITARY_country_owns_*`, `WA_AI_MILITARY_faction_owns_*`) for Exclusive types only. | Yes, by design: Country overrides Faction overrides Default for Exclusive keys. |
| 6 | Validation harness: parity tests under `tests/`, optional in-game logging effect that dumps active strategies per AI per tick. | None. |

Each phase is a separate PR. Do not pre-empt later phases inside earlier ones.
